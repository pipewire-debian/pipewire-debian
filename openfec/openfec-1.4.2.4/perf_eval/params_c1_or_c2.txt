# This is the file that gathers all the parameters that control performance
# evaluation tests. It is used both during simulations and during graph
# generation. Feel free to edit this file as appropriate.
#

# NB: this version is for curves 1 or 2:
#	-curve=1    decoding bitrate W.R.T. loss percentage
#	-curve=2    encoding bitrate W.R.T. loss percentage
# Here it is very important to set up a valid symbol size, as it has great
# impacts on the encoding/decoding speeds.

# Path to the performance evaluation tool used during the first step (simulations).

# WARNING: use the Debug version of eperftool if you want to do statistics on
# symbol XOR operations.

# Name of the trace file during the first step (simulation).
# At the end of the tests, this file contains all the raw test results (useful
# for future analyses if need be).

# Prefix (resp. suffix) to be used for the files during the second step (curve
# generation). Useful to easily identify curves associated to a given simulation.
# Leave these variables empty if not interested.

#			test iteration configuration				#
#################################################################################

#
# A test is a set of executions (iterations) of the performance evaluation tool
# with the same parameters, except the PRNG seed which changes at each time.
# This PRNG seed is used to determine the LDPC matrix (if applicable), the packet
# scheduling, the erasures in the channel, etc.). Practically, the PRNG seed is
# equal to:	1 + iteration_id 	(we add 1 to avoid value 0).
#

# Number of iterations for each test.
# It is essential to initialize this variable accordingly in order to have reliable
# minimum/average/maximum or decoding failure probability curves. In particular,
# for decoding failure probability curves, nb_iterations must be large enough.
#
nb_iterations	1000

# Start tests at this offset.
# This is useful either to split a particularly long test on several machines:
# each of them are given different iteration index ranges, e.g. host1 performs
# 1,000,000 tests starting at offset 0, while host2 performs 1,000,000 tests
# starting at offset 1,000,000.
# This is also useful to add some iterations to an existing simulation, without
# having to start all over again (be careful not to set erase_database to false
# in that case).
#
offset_iteration	0

# Number of iterations before inserting the results into the database.
# This is useful in case of very long tests (e.g., that last several hours or days)
# in order to have partial results and get quickly an idea of the results (you
# can start intermediate curve generation even if the simulation is not finished).
#
nb_iterations_for_partial_results	1000

# General simulation parameters related to the AL-FEC code being studied.

# List of codecs to consider as provided by eperftool -h:
#     1: RS over GF(2^8) stable codec
#     2: RS over GF(2^m) (with m=4 or 8), stable codec
#     3: LDPC-Staircase stable codec (default)
#     5: 2D parity check matrix stable codec
#     6: LDPC, with a binary H matrix specified in a file, advanced codec
# You can specify one or several codes.

# List of code rates, specified as float values, to consider. There can be one
# or more code rates. Fractions are NOT accepted.
#
# WARNING: choose whether the code rate(s) or the number(s) of repair symbols should
# be specified, but do not specify both of them.

# List of symbol sizes (in bytes) to consider. You can specify one or several sizes.
# WARNING: if the goal is to evaluate the erasure correction capabilities, then
# choose 4 bytes to speed up simulations. If the goal is to measure the encoding
# or decoding performance, choose the right value as it will significantly impact
# the speed.
#
symbol_size	1024

# LDPC codes only: list of N1 values to use, i.e. the target number of "1"s per
# source column in the parity check matrix H (in <min> <max> <step> format).
#
ldpc_N1		7 7 1

# Set find_min_overhead to true if you want to launch tests for curves that
# plot the decoding failure probability as a function of the loss rate or
# (equivalently) the overhead. For all other curves, do not use find_min_overhead.
# This is equivalent to using eperftool with the -find_min_overhead argument.
# This parameter is not meaningful with MDS codes (e.g., Reed-Solomon).

find_min_overhead	false

#	  		transmission and loss configuration			#
#################################################################################

# Transmission type (i.e., the packet scheduling at the sender), as defined by
# eperftool:
#
#    0		randomly send all source + repair symbols (default)
#    1		randomly send a few source symbols (not necessarily received)
#			+ all repair symbols
#    2		randomly send few src symbols first (always received), then randomly
#			all repair symbols
#    3		randomly send only repair symbols (non systematic use, so make sure
#			the code rate is lower or equal to 0.5)
#    4		sequentially send all src symbols first, then repair symbols
#    5		sequentially send all repair symbols first, then src symbols
#    6		sequentially send all src symbols first, then randomly repair symbols
#    7		sequentially send all repair symbols first, then randomly src symbols
#
# WARNING: this parameter is ignored in find_min_overhead mode (it automatically
# select loss type 0 associated with transmission type 0).

# Channel loss type (i.e., the way losses occur during transmission), as defined by
# eperftool.
#
#    0		no loss (default)
#		syntax:	loss 0
#    1		simulate random losses using two state markov model
#		syntax:	loss 1 n1 n2
#		with	n1: loss probability in OK state (integer, default 1)
#			n2: success probability in NOK state (integer, default 25)
#    2		simulate random losses by specifying the target loss probability
#			(floating point value), using a <min> <max> <step> format.
#		syntax:	loss 2 min max step
#    3		simulate random losses by specifying the target number of losses
#			(rather than probability), using a <min> <max> <step> format.
#		syntax:	loss 3 min max step
#    4		simulate losses by randomly choosing one packet out of all each steps

#			database configuration					#
#################################################################################

# Set to true to erase the SQL database when launching a new test.
# Set to false to append new simultation results to an existing SQL database.
# WARNING: make sure this parameter is initialized appropriately before launching
#	new tests!
#
erase_database  true

# The SQL database can be either a file or an SQL server.
# - if you want to use a local SQLite database, please install the Perl DBI::SQLite
#	driver before launching the tests. The format is:
#		database file <file>
#	Warning: if you want to use an SQLite file, using_ml MUST be set to false
#	since SQLite does not authorize concurrent access to the file.
#
# - If you want to use an MySQL database, possibly on a remote server, make sure
#	the database on the server exists (an empty one, tables will be created
#	automatically if required). This is the most powerful solution as sub-tests
#	can be launched on several machines (for higher speed) and aggregated in the
#	same SQL database. The format is:
#		database server <database_name> <host> <port> <user> <password>
#

database file performance_test.db
#database server test 192.168.1.11 3306 root root
