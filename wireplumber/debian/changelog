wireplumber (0.4.11-1~ubuntu21.10) impish; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Add new wireplumber-locales package

  wireplumber - 

    Changes:
    
      - The libcamera monitor is now enabled by default, so if the libcamera source
        is enabled in PipeWire, cameras discovered with the libcamera API will be
        available out of the box. This is safe to use alongside V4L2, as long as
        the user does not try to use the same camera over different APIs at the same
        time
      - Libcamera and V4L2 nodes now get assigned a ``priority.session`` number;
        V4L2 nodes get a higher priority by default, so the default camera is going
        to be /dev/video0 over V4L2, unless changed with ``wpctl``
      - Libcamera nodes now get a user-friendly description based on their location
        (ex. built-in front camera). Additionally, V4L2 nodes now have a "(V4L2)"
        string appended to their description in order to be distinguished from
        the libcamera ones
      - 50-alsa-config.lua now has a section where you can set properties that
        will only be applied if WirePlumber is running in a virtual machine. By
        default it now sets ``api.alsa.period-size = 256`` and
        ``api.alsa.headroom = 8192`` (#162, #134)
    
    Fixes:
    
      - The "enabled" properties in the config files are now "true" by default
        when they are not defined. This fixes backwards compatibility with older
        configuration files (#254)
      - Fixed device name deduplication in the alsa monitor, when device reservation
        is enabled (#241)
      - Reverted a previous fix that makes it possible again to get a glitch when
        changing default nodes while also changing the profile (GNOME Settings).
        The fix was causing other problems and the issue will be addressed
        differently in the future (#279)
      - Fixed an issue that would prevent applications from being moved to a
        recently plugged USB headset (#293)
      - Fixed an issue where wireplumber would automatically link control ports,
        if they are enabled, to audio ports, effectively breaking audio (#294)
      - The policy now always considers the profile of a device that was previously
        selected by the user, if it is available, when deciding which profile to
        activate (#179). This may break certain use cases (see !360)
      - A few documentation fixes
    
    Tools:
    
      - wpctl now has a ``get-volume`` command for easier scripting of volume controls
      - wpctl now supports relative steps and percentage-based steps in ``set-volume``
      - wpctl now also prints link states
      - wpctl can now ``inspect`` metadata objects without showing critical warnings
    
    Library:
    
      - A new WpDBus API was added to maintain a single D-Bus connection among
        modules that need one
      - WpCore now has a method to get the virtual machine type, if WirePlumber
        is running in a virtual machine
      - WpSpaDevice now has a ``wp_spa_device_new_managed_object_iterator()`` method
      - WpSpaJson now has a ``wp_spa_json_to_string()`` method that returns a newly
        allocated string with the correct size of the string token
      - WpLink now has a ``WP_LINK_FEATURE_ESTABLISHED`` that allows the caller to
        wait until the link is in the PAUSED or ACTIVE state. This transparently
        now enables watching links for negotiation or allocation errors and failing
        gracefully instead of keeping dead link objects around (#294)
    
    Misc:
    
      - The Lua subproject was bumped to version 5.4.4

wireplumber (0.4.10.r48.g37bd392-1~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Add new wireplumber-locales package

  wireplumber - 

    Changes:

      - Added i18n support to be able to translate some user-visible strings
      - wpctl now supports using ''@DEFAULT_{AUDIO_,VIDEO_,}{SINK,SOURCE}@'' as ID,
        almost like pactl. Additionally, it supports a ''--pid'' flag for changing
        volume and mute state by specifying a process ID, applying the state to all
        nodes of a specific client process
      - The Lua engine now supports loading Lua libraries. These can be placed
        either in the standard Lua libraries path or in the "lib" subdirectory
        of WirePlumber's "scripts" directory and can be loaded with ''require()''
      - The Lua engine's sandbox has been relaxed to allow more functionality
        in scripts (the debug & coroutine libraries and some other previously
        disabled functions)
      - Lua scripts are now wrapped in special WpPlugin objects, allowing them to
        load asynchronously and declare when they have finished their loading
      - Added a new script that provides the same functionality as
        module-fallback-sink from PipeWire, but also takes endpoints into account
        and can be customized more easily. Disabled by default for now to avoid
        conflicts
    
    Policy:
    
      - Added an optional experimental feature that allows filter-like streams
        (like echo-cancel or filter-node) to match the channel layout of the
        device they connect to, on both sides of the filter; that means that if,
        for instance, a sink has 6 channels and the echo-cancel's source stream
        is linked to that sink, then the virtual sink presented by echo-cancel
        will also be configured to the same 6 channels layout. This feature needs
        to be explicitly enabled in the configuration ("filter.forward-format")
      - filter-like streams (filter-chain and such) no longer follow the default
        sink when it changes, like in PulseAudio
    
    Fixes:
    
      - The suspend-node script now also suspends nodes that go into the "error"
        state, allowing them to recover from errors without having to restart
        WirePlumber
      - Fixed a crash in mixer-api when setting volume with channelVolumes (#250)
      - logind module now watches only for user state changes, avoiding errors when
        machined is not running
    
    Misc:
    
      - The configuration files now have comments mentioning which options need to
        be disabled in order to run WirePlumber without D-Bus
      - The configuration files now have properties to enable/disable the monitors
        and other sections, so that it is possible to disable them by dropping in
        a file that just sets the relevant property to false

wireplumber (0.4.9.r8.g812fc9b-1~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Nothing

  wireplumber - 

    Fixes:

      - restore-stream no longer crashes if properties for it are not present
        in the config (#190)
      - spa-json no longer crashes on non-x86 architectures
      - Fixed a potential crash in the bluetooth auto-switch module (#193)
      - Fixed a race condition that would cause Zoom desktop audio sharing to fail
        (#197)
      - Surround sound in some games is now exposed properly (pipewire#876)
      - Fixed a race condition that would cause the default source & sink to not
        be set at startup
      - policy-node now supports the 'target.object' key on streams and metadata
      - Multiple fixes in policy-node that make the logic in some cases behave
        more like PulseAudio (regarding nodes with the dont-reconnect property
        and regarding following the default source/sink)
      - Fixed a bug with parsing unquoted strings in spa-json

    Misc:

      - The policy now supports configuring "persistent" device profiles. If a
        device is *manually* set to one of these profiles, then it will not be
        auto-switched to another profile automatically under any circumstances
        (#138, #204)
      - The device-activation module was re-written in lua
      - Brave, Edge, Vivaldi and Telegram were added in the bluetooth auto-switch
        applications list
      - ALSA nodes now use the PCM name to populate node.nick, which is useful
        at least on HDA cards using UCM, where all outputs (analog, hdmi, etc)
        are exposesd as nodes on a single profile
      - An icon name is now set on the properties of bluetooth devices

wireplumber (0.4.8.r20.gb95da33-1~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Nothing

  wireplumber - 

    - Added bluetooth profile auto-switching support. Bluetooth headsets will now
      automatically switch to the HSP/HFP profile when making a call and go back
      to the A2DP profile after the call ends (#90)
  
    - Added an option (enabled by default) to auto-switch to echo-cancel virtual
      device nodes when the echo-cancel module is loaded in pipewire-pulse, if
      there is no other configured default node
  
    Fixes:
    
      - Fixed a regression that prevented nodes from being selected as default when
        using the pro-audio profile (#163)
      - Fixed a regression that caused encoded audio streams to stall (#178)
      - Fixed restoring bluetooth device profiles
    
    Library:
    
      - A new WpSpaJson API was added as a front-end to spa-json. This is also
        exposed to Lua, so that Lua scripts can natively parse and write data in
        the spa-json format
    
    Misc:
    
      - wpctl can now list the configured default sources and sinks and has a new
        command that allows clearing those configured defaults, so that wireplumber
        goes back to choosing the default nodes based on node priorities
      - The restore-stream script now has its own configuration file in
        main.lua.d/40-stream-defaults.lua and has independent options for
        restoring properties and target nodes
      - The restore-stream script now supports rule-based configuration to disable
        restoring volume properties and/or target nodes for specific streams,
        useful for applications that misbehave when we restore those (see #169)
      - policy-endpoint now assigns the "Default" role to any stream that does not
        have a role, so that it can be linked to a pre-configured endpoint
      - The route-settings-api module was dropped in favor of dealing with json
        natively in Lua, now that the API exists

     - Fixed a regression in 0.4.6 that caused the echo-cancellation pipewire
       module (and possibly others) to not work
     - A default sink or source is now not selected if there is no available route
       for it (#145)
     - Fixed an issue where some clients would wait for a bit while seeking (#146)

wireplumber (0.4.5.r46.ge04acbd-1~ubuntu20.04) focal; urgency=medium

  Debian Package - 

    - Nothing

  wireplumber - 
    
  - Fixed a crash that could happen after a node linking error (#76)
  - Fixed a bug that would cause capture streams to link to monitor ports
    of loopback nodes instead of linking to their capture ports
  - Fixed a needless wait that would happen on applications using the pipewire
    ALSA plugin (#92)
  - Fixed an issue that would cause endless rescan loops in policy-node and
    could potentially also cause other strange behaviors in case pavucontrol
    or another monitoring utility was open while the policy was rescanning (#77)
  - Fixed the endpoints-based policy that broke in recent versions and improved
    its codebase to share more code and be more in-line with policy-node
  - The semicolon character is now escaped properly in state files (#82)
  - When a player requests encoded audio passthrough, the policy now prefers
    linking to a device that supports that instead of trying to link to the
    default device and potentially failing (#75)
  - Miscellaneous robustness fixes in policy-node
  - For more, See : https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/pipewire/wireplumber/-/releases

  - docs: remove protected
  - annotations from functions to show them in the docs
  - policy: use a scheduleRescan function to avoid unneeded rescans

  Debian Package - 

    - Initial Release

  wireplumber - 
    
    Fixes:

      - Fixed filtering of pw_metadata objects, which broke with PipeWire 0.3.31
      - Fixed a potential livelock condition in si-audio-adapter/endpoint where

        "media.role" of the nodes and the "device.intended-roles" of the devices

    Build system:

      - Bumped GLib requirement to 2.62, as the code was already using 2.62 API
      - Added support for building WirePlumber as a PipeWire subproject
      - Doxygen version requirement has been relaxed to accept v1.8
      - The CI now also verifies that the build works on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
