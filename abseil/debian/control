Description: extensions to the C++ standard library
 Abseil is an open-source collection of C++ library code designed to augment the
 C++ standard library. The Abseil library code is collected from Google's C++
 codebase and has been extensively tested and used in production. In some cases,
 Abseil provides pieces missing from the C++ standard; in others, Abseil
 provides alternatives to the standard for special needs.
