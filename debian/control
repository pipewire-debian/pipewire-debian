Description: libraries for the PipeWire multimedia server
 PipeWire is a server and user space API to deal with multimedia
 pipelines. This includes:
 .
  - Making available sources of video (such as from a capture devices or
    application provided streams) and multiplexing this with clients.
  - Accessing sources of video for consumption.
  - Generating graphs for audio and video processing.
