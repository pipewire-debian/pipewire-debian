Description: Python 2.x bindings for gobject-introspection libraries
 GObject is an abstraction layer that allows programming with an object
 paradigm that is compatible with many languages. It is a part of Glib,
 the core library used to build GTK+ and GNOME.
 .
 This package contains the Python 2.x binding generator for libraries that
 support gobject-introspection, i. e. which ship a gir1.2-<name>-<version>
 package. With these packages, the libraries can be used from Python.

Description: Python 2.x bindings for GObject - transitional package
 This package will bring the two versions of GObject Python modules: the
 deprecated gobject module, and the new gobject-introspection system. It
 is here for upgrade purposes only. You can remove it safely when
 nothing else depends on it.
