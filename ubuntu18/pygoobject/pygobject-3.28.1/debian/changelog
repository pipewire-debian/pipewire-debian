  * debian/control{,.in}: Build-Conflict with
    open-infrastructure-locales-c.utf-8. This package gratutiously breaks our
    testsuite because it provides 'locales' without actually providing all the
    functionality of the locales package (specifically
    /usr/share/i18n/charmaps in our case). See #859912.

pygobject (3.18.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix rules when deciding for which architecture the test-suite failure
    should be non-fatal. Use filter instead of findstring, as findstring also
    matches substrings (e.g. adding kfreebsd-amd64 did also make the amd64
    test-suite non-fatal).
  * Make the test-suite fatal for all architectures so we can more easily
    detect failures.
  * Make the test-suite non-fatal for the the -dbg builds. With python3.4-dbg
    and python3.5-dbg the test-suite currently fails. We still run it to get
    the result for all architectures.

pygobject (3.10.2-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Fix building for multiple Python 3 versions.
  * 00git_non_recursive_make_python.patch: Avoid clash between gi/types.py and
    the Python standard library when installing, which broke installation with
    Python 3.4 (https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=721025).

  * debian/control.in: Bump glib and g-i dependencies for new release.
  * debian/control.in: Drop explicit python3-dbg dependency, dh-python got
    fixed now (see #704579).
  * debian/control.in: Add at-spi2-core build dependency, as apparently this
    is somehow needed on the buildds (not reproducible in sbuild).
    (Closes: #715536)
  * debian/control.in: Add Breaks for older python-aptdaemon and
    software-center (Ubuntu specific) to avoid potential crash caused by new
    python-gi with old python-aptdaemon. (LP: #1173249)
  * debian/rules: Stop renaming the *.so files, upstream does it correctly
    now.

pygobject (3.8.1-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules:
    + Don't abort if the test suite fails on hurd.
    + We build for all the available python flavours. Previously we
      were removing the prefix to which we install before installing
      each flavour. We didn't notice any problems because we were
      building only once for python3, but now that we build for 3.2
      and 3.3, let's not remove the python3.2 bits when we install
      the 3.3 stuff. This fixes pygobject on python3.2. Closes: #707318.
    + Stop running the test suite on kfreebsd as it currently hangs
      (see #707733).

 -- Emilio Pozuelo Monfort <pochu@debian.org>  Sat, 11 May 2013 17:22:49 +0200

    "[xxx refs]" error message failing the tests.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.4. No changes necessary.
  * Have failing tests fail the build except on s390x and mipsel, where they
    currently fail.
  * debian/control.in: Add explicit python3-dbg dependency to python3-gi-dbg,
    to work around dh_python3 bug #704579.

pygobject (3.8.0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Emilio Pozuelo Monfort ]
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/rules:
    + Unconditionally run the tests again, since the problem is not
      kernel related.
  * debian/patches/01_cairo_region.patch,
    debian/control.in:
    + Add a foreign type for cairo_region_t. Bump py3cairo build/binary
      dependencies. (LP: #1028115, bgo #667959). Thanks to Martin Pitt
      for this change.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/rules: Set $HOME to debian/tmp/home, so that the testsuite has a
    writeable home directory for D-BUS sockets and XDG data. This fixes the
    eternal hangs in sbuild.

pygobject (3.7.92-3) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/rules: The test suite causes an eternal hang on Debian's buildds,
    presumably due to running on very old kernels (2.6.32). This needs more
    debugging, but skip the tests for kernels < 3.4 for now.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/control.in: Make python-gi-dev Arch: any, as it now uses multiarch

  * debian/control.in: Put transitional packages into section oldlibs, and
    priority extra. Thanks lintian.
  * debian/control.in: Fix non-bin-NMUable dependency of python-gobject-dev.
  * Add lintian overrides to suppress the package-name-doesnt-match-sonames
    warnings.
  * Add lintian override for "dbg-package-missing-depends python-gobject-dbg";
    this is a transitional package only.
  * Bump g-i build dependency to >= 1.34.2 to ensure the tests are working.
  * Add autopkgtests for the -dbg flavours of Python 2 and 3.
  * debian/control.in: Have python-gi-dev depend on python3-gi, too.
    (LP: #1101683)

  [ Josselin Mouette ]
  * Enable again gtk3 on m68k.
  * Add missing dependency python3-gi-cairo → python3-gi. (Closes: #673213)

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Stop using a doc symlink for the dbg package. The space savings are
    negligible and they are prone to cause problems. In case of
    python-gobject-dbg, which was converted to a transitional package, the
    symlink was mistakenly converted to a real directory which isn't handled
    nicely by dpkg. (Closes: #700779)
  * Use strict dependencies in python-gi-dev as the package is now
    Architecture: any
  * Tighten the dependency on python-gi-dev for python-gobject-dev.

pygobject (3.4.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Drop quilt (not necessary, we are using 3.0 (quilt) source format), and
    dh_autoreconf (we have no patches).
  * Greatly simplify debian/rules, by switching to dh7 build system and
    factorizing the per-flavor rules in a simpler and better way. Also move to
    dh compat 9 to get multiarch compatible library directories.
  * debian/control.in: Bump g-i requirement according to upstream
    configure.ac.
  * debian/control.in: Drop support for Python 2.6. It's going to be dropped
    after Wheezy anyway, it receives zero testing by upstream and will soon be
    dropped upstream anyway.
  * debian/rules: Use py3versions --supported instead of --requested; the
    former is broken right now and we don't request particular versions anyway.
  * debian/control.in: Add missing ${misc:Pre-Depends} and versioned dpkg-dev
    build dependency.

    Closes: #673213.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Stop using a doc symlink for the dbg package. The space savings are
    negligible and they are prone to cause problems. In case of
    python-gobject-dbg, which was converted to a transitional package, the
    symlink was mistakenly converted to a real directory which isn't handled
    nicely by dpkg. Closes: #700779

    previous release. This changes existing behaviour (model values being str
    instead of unicode) and also makes tree model behaviour incompatible to
    the rest of Gtk behaviour (which always returns UTF-8 encoded str objects,
    not unicode). The original bug description was a bug in the test case

  * debian/control.in: Update Vcs-* for experimental branch.
  * New upstream release:
    - New rewritten invoker is twice as fast and easier to extend and debug
    - Complete break from static bindings so we may improve the core without
      breaking legacy APIs
    - Better type handling
    - Parallel installable with PyGObject 2.28 for legacy binding support
      (2.28 must be compiled with –disable-introspection)
    - Fixed object array handling
    - Added more overrides for PyGTK API emulation
    - Support for function calling using keyword arguments
    - GObject and GLib symbols can now have overrides
    - All static bit removed or made private
    - GVariants now work from callback returns
    - Note that this now enforces a consistent move to the GI bindings. I. e.
      you need to change all "import gobject" statements into "from
      gi.repository import GObject", same for glib.
   * Drop debian/patches/00git_*.patch, all upstream.
   * Drop 20_deprecated_spam.patch, obsolete.
   * debian/control.in: The static bindings (glib, gobject, pygtk, gtk, etc.)
     are deprecated and are now shipped in the separate packages
     python-gobject-2{,-dbg}. Add a dependency to these for the time being to
     not break backwards compatibility. Once all packages have been ported to
     use the GI bindings, this dependency and pygobject-2 will be dropped.
   * debian/control.in: Update package descriptions to point out that this is
     now GI only.
   * debian/control.in, debian/rules: Drop python-gobject-dev package. It's
     not relevant any more for this version, and now built from the
     pygobject-2 source package.
  * debian/rules: Bump shlibs.
  * Drop debian/python-gobject.examples: These are for the old static
    bindings. http://git.gnome.org/browse/pygobject/tree/demos is an actually
    useful and comprehensive example, but not shipped in the release tarballs.

    - 00git_gio_test.patch: Port test_properties from static gio to GI Gio, so
      that the tests will also work with Python 3.
  * debian/control.in, debian/rules: Add and build python3-gobject and
    python3-gobject-dbg packages. Until we get py3cairo packaged in Debian (in
    the works), we need to build the python3 flavour with --disable-cairo, and
    apply some workarounds in debian/rules (see the "FIXME"s); these will

    gtk-2.0 directory, to avoid instantly breaking all reverse dependencies.
    This needs to stay until they get converted to dh_python2.
  * Fix test suite calls during package build (Closes: #619257):
    - debian/rules: Copy Python files from our modules into build tree, so
      that the tests actually find them. In Python you can't have Python
      modules and compiled extensions which belong to the same import in
      different directories. (Unfortunately it's hard to upstream this, so
      keep it as a Debian specific hack for now.)
    - debian/rules: Run the tests under xvfb so that the Gdk/Gtk ones can
      succeed.
    - debian/rules: Disable fakeroot for the tests by unsetting $LD_PRELOAD.
      Otherwise the tests try to connect to root's session D-BUS.
    - debian/control.in: Add build dependencies: xvfb (as we now use it in
      debian/rules), dbus-x11 (as the test suite uses dbus-launch), and
      python-apt-dbg/python-cairo-dbg, so that the test cases for the debug

  * Pass PYTHON to $(MAKE) runs for robustness in case of timestamp skews;
    thanks Colin Watson; closes: #509192.
  * Pass --disable-maintainer-mode to configure.
  * Rework patch and config.sub/.guess handling: backup config.guess and .sub,
    call quilt instead of relying on cdbs' quilt patchsys, restore
    config.guess and .sub after unpatching.  This avoids config.guess and .sub
    in the diff, and allows control over fully working and fully patched
    trees.
  * Call dh_* -s instead of -a in binary-arch.
  * Rework install rules and dependencies completely to avoid .PHONY implicit
    targets.

  [ Josselin Mouette ]
  * Install files to the python-support directory since objcopy is
    completely stupid and doesn’t add the full pathname to the
    .gnu_debuglink section. Closes: #518026.
  * New upstream release.
  * 63_macro-dir.patch: removed, merged upstream.
  * 90_autofoo.patch: regenerated.
  * Fix quilt invocation so that patches are applied.
  * Pass echo=/bin/echo to the environment to work around the ☠☢☣⚡⚠✈║
    libtool bug that is not able to find a command as simple as echo, is
    that really too much to ask?
  * 04_testsuite_gtk.patch: new patch. Don’t run tests that require
    pygtk being installed.

      Thanks a lot to Loïc Minier for his help and guidance!

  * Don’t move the -dbg symbolic link to the -dev package.
  * Run dh_makeshlibs separately for python-gobject-dbg.

pygobject (2.14.1-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revert last upload, the pygobject patch was fine and the bug lies in
    pygtk. Furthermore, wakeupfd gets used anyway since Python supports

    PYTHON_INCLUDES; fixes support for -dbg package; GNOME #448173;
    closes: #468130.  NB: the patch also ships m4/ from upstream SVN as this
    wasn't disted properly and also updated autoconf.
