    - Generate ddebs from debhelper instead of pkg-create-dbgsym:
      + Make debhelper Conflict/Replace pkg-create-dbgsym to force it off.
      + Set DBGSYM_PACKAGE_TYPE to ddeb to get correct debian/files output.
    - dh_installchangelogs: Do not install upstream changelog in compat

debhelper (12.1.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_installinitramfs: Install hooks as executable rather than
    plan files.  Thanks to Thorsten Glaser for the report.
    (Closes: #922990)
  * dh_compress: Fix bug where examples where compressed when a
    doc package shipped examples for another package.  Thanks to
    Christian Kastner for reporting this.  (Closes: #922267)

  [ Xavier Guimard ]
  * dh_fixperms: add .node in mode_0644_patterns.

  [ Sylvestre Ledru ]
  * dh_strip: Print a warning when an ELF binary does not have a
    build-id (or when dh_strip cannot find it).

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Strip leading and trailing whitespace from lines in
    regular debhelper config files.  Whitespace-only lines from
    executable config files are now explicitly detected and triggers
    a human readable error message early rather than warnings/errors
    about uninitialized variables.   Thanks to Ben Finney for the
    suggestion and the initial patch.  (Closes: #919853)
  * meson.pm: Dump "meson-logs/testlog.txt" if testing fails with
    an error.  Thanks to Jeremy Bicha for the suggestion.
    (Closes: #918066)
  * dh_missing: Clarify the documentation about when -X with other
    helpers can may dh_missing ignore paths that are not installed.
    Thanks to Hilko Bengen for reporting the original documentation
    was unsufficient.  (Closes: #917362)
  * d/control: Bump Standards-Version to 4.3.0 - no changes required.

  [ Baptiste Jammet ]
  * fr.po: Update French translation.  (Closes: #921254)

debhelper (12) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * Release debhelper/12 marking compat 12 as stable.
  * dh: Special NOOP PROMISE of cli-options() to always allow skipping
    the helper (as we know no option can make it change behaviour).

  [ Dmitry Shachnev ]
  * dh_compress: Do not compress mkdocs search indices
    (search_index.json).

debhelper (11.5.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Reopen stdin to read from /dev/null in doit (and its sibling
    functions) to prevent issues when stdin is open in write-only mode
    (which is what nohup(1) does).  Thanks to Julian Gilbey for reporting
    the issue and providing a sample patch for it as well.
    (Closes: #913663)
  * fr.po: Add missing dash in "--parallel" in a translation.  Thanks to
    Christian Marillat for reporting the issue.  (Closes: #915255)
  * debhelper.7: Document that the "python-distutils" build system is
    removed in compat 12.  Thanks to Axel Beckert for reporting the
    omission.  (Closes: #915530)

  [ Luca Boccassi ]
  * makefile.pm: revert passing V=0/1 to makefiles. Fixes FTBFS in apcupsd
    (and possibly more).
    (Closes: #914419)

    - Generate ddebs from debhelper instead of pkg-create-dbgsym
      + Make debhelper Conflict/Replace pkg-create-dbgsym to force it off.
      + Set DBGSYM_PACKAGE_TYPE to ddeb to get correct debian/files output.

debhelper (11.5.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Helmut Grohne ]
  * cmake.pm: Pass the usual CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR for ppc64el
    when cross compiling.   (Closes: #913425)

debhelper (11.5.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Luca Boccassi ]
  * makefile.pm: Pass V=0 or V=1 to the make file depending on
    whether "terse" is set in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * dh_gconf: Mark dh_gconf as deprecated (see #908845).
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Separate lowest non-deprecated compat level and
    the lowest compat level we generate "debhelper-compat (= X)"
    relations for.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Open compat level 13 as an experimental compat
    level.
  * meson.pm: In compat 13, run tests with "meson test" rather
    than "ninja test".  Thanks to Simon McVittie for the
    suggestion.  (Closes: #912560)
  * dh: Correctly include dh_installsystemduser in the sequence
    in compat 12.  It was excluded due to an inverted boolean
    meaning it was added in compat up to (and incl.) compat 11.
    Thanks to Michael Biebl for reporting the issue.
    (Closes: #913329)
  * fr.po: Correct translations for dh_installman.1 which
    incorrectly implied that dh_installman was deprecated.
    Thanks to Laurent Bigonville for reporting the issue.
    (Closes: #912978)

  [ Helmut Grohne ]
  * cmake.pm: Pass QMAKE_EXECUTABLE when cross-building.
    (Closes: #913415)

debhelper (11.5.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_systemd_start: Fix bug introduced in debhelper/11.5 where
    dh_systemd_start would fail to substitute a token in the
    generated maintscript for maintainer scripts when using
    "--restart-after-upgrade" (including when the option is
    on by default).  Thanks to Colin Watson for reporting the
    bug.  (Closes: #912420)

debhelper (11.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Daniele Nicolodi ]
  * dh_installsystemduser: New helper responsible for istalling package
    maintainer supplied systemd user instance units and to produce
    postinst and postrm maintiner scripts code blocks to appropriately
    enable, mask and disable units when the package is installed,
    upgraded, or removed.  (Closes: #764678)

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * dh_installsystemd.1: Improve the documentation for --name to make
    it more clear that it also changes the name of the source files in
    the debian directory.  Thanks to Emel Hasdal for reporting the
    issue and reviewing the change.  (Closes: #899983)

 -- Niels Thykier <niels@thykier.net>  Sun, 28 Oct 2018 16:07:01 +0000

debhelper (11.4.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * debhelper.pod: Quote the value of INSTALL in description of
    compat level 11.  Thanks to Josh Triplett for the suggestion
    (Closes: #908906)
  * d/changelog: Fix typos in old entries.
  * dh_strip: Remove empty /usr/lib/debug directories left over
    by dh_dwz.  Thanks to Ferenc Wágner for reporting the issue.
    (Closes: #909303)
  * dh: Disable optimization to skip tools based on command-line
    parameters when dh is passed long options.  Since debhelper
    had implicit support for auto-abbrevation of long options
    and people have started to rely on it, the optimization in
    debhelper/11.4 caused regressions.  The optimization is
    still enabled for short options.  (Closes: #909704)

  [ Josh Triplett ]
  * debhelper.pod: Document how to declare the debhelper compat
    level via the "debhelper-compat (= X)"-method.
    (Closes: #908909)
  * debhelper.pod: Document that we do not provide debhelper-compat
    for experimental/beta versions of compat levels.
    (Closes: #908907)
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: Fix typos.

 -- Niels Thykier <niels@thykier.net>  Sun, 30 Sep 2018 15:49:38 +0000

debhelper (11.4) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * dh_dwz.1: Remove now obsolete note in manpage claming that dh_dwz
    was experimental.  Since debhelper/11.3, dh_dwz was no longer
    experimental.
  * cmake.pm: Explicitly set CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR on native builds.
    This should not make any pratical difference but aligns the
    behaviour of native and cross builds.  Thanks to Simon McVittie
    for the suggestion.  (Closes: #903042)
  * autoconf.pm: Leave --libexecdir at upstream default (/usr/libexec)
    in compat 12 and later.  (Closes: #859724)
  * meson.pm: Ditto.
  * dh: Support implicitly loading addons via "dh-sequence-${name}"
    relations in Build-Depends (which would imply "dh ... --with ${name}").
    Only simple relations in Build-Depends are considered at the moment.
  * debian/control: Provide dh-sequence-dwz, dh-sequence-installinitramfs,
    and dh-sequence-systemd, which enables packages to use the new
    feature to implicitly autoload dh addons via Build-Depends.
  * dh_md5sums: Rewrite handling of conffiles and excludes to better
    support an arbitrary number of files that should be omitted from the
    md5sums file.  Previously, dh_md5sums could fail with the error:
    """... "/bin/sh": Argument list too long at ..."""
    (Closes: #864182)
  * dh_installinit.1: Correct documentation which was inaccurate in relation
    to which compat levels where dh_installinit still supported systemd
    items and upstart jobs.  Thanks to Theodore Y. Ts'o for bring up the
    issue.
  * dh_installdeb: In compat 12, ignore the maintainer provided conffiles.
    It has not been useful since compat 3.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: isnative() now also resets $dh{VERSION} as a side-effect when
    using the cache to answer the request.  This is mostly useful because
    it enables the following optimization.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Have isnative() special-case debian/changelog to avoid
    reparsing that file over and over in the same helper.
  * dh_gconf: Explicitly declare the --priority parameter with the intention
    to remove it from the default debhelper options.
  * dh_installemacsen: Ditto.
  * dh_installgsettings: Ditto.
  * dh_installudev: Ditto.
  * dh_installwm: Ditto.
  * Dh_Getopt.pm: Remove --priority from the list of options supported by all
    debhelper tools.  The only external consumer was dh_installtex from
    tex-common, which was fixed in 6.10.
  * dh_installinit: In compat 12, pass --skip-systemd-native to update-rc.d
    to make it ignore systemd services.
  * dh_installsystemd: In compat 12, avoid relying on dh_installinit's
    shell snippets for starting services.  (Closes: #887904, #887900)
  * dh_installinit: Drop unnecessary "systemctl daemon-reload" in
    auto-generated postrm script.  The systemd package has a trigger for
    handling sysvinit scripts and dh_installsystemd handles the requirement
    for native systemd unit files.
  * dh_clean: Explicitly declare the -k/--keep parameter with the intention
    to remove it from the default debhelper options.
  * dh_installchangelogs: Ditto.
  * dh_strip: Ditto.
  * Dh_Getopt.pm: Remove -k/--keep from the list of options supported by all
    debhelper tools.  The only external consumer was dh_gtkmodules which is now
    deprecated and a "noop" command.  No consumers of dh_gtkmodules appear to
    pass -k/--keep to dh_gtkmodules any longer.
  * dh: Rewrite command line optimization logic to enable support for a new
    NOOP PROMISE for command line options.  This will make dh able to skip
    helpers in some cases even when passed options.  (Closes: #866581)
  * dh_*: Add a NOOP PROMISE for command options where applicable.
  * dh: Remove old compatibility code from compat 10 that never worked.
  * Dh_Getopt.pm: Fix a bug that would make "-S" be interpreted as "-s" when
    "-S" was not given an argument.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Versions to 4.2.1 - no changes required.
  * debhelper.pod: Declare compat 12 in beta testing.

  [ Juhani Numminen ]
  * dh_installsystemd.1: Fix typo in manpage.
  * dh_installinit.1: Ditto.

  [ Fabian Wolff ]
  * dh_installdocs.1: Fix typo.
  * dh_link.1: Ditto.

  [ Nicholas Guriev ]
  * cmake.pm, autoconf.pm: honor QUIET setting (closes: #907738).
  * Dh_Lib.pm: use terse build option to set QUIET setting (closes: #907595).

  [ Clément Hermann ]
  * debhelper.pod: Document dh_golang's DH_GOLANG_EXCLUDES behaviour change
    for compat 12 (closes: #908656)

debhelper (11.3.5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Dh_Lib.pm: Introduce a new glob_expand error handler to
    better emulate the old style glob code to fail when a
    non-glob entry in the config file is missing.
  * dh_installdocs: Use the new glob_expand error handler to
    restore the behaviour to that of debhelper/10.5.1 and older.
    Thanks to Christoph Berg for reporting the issue.
    (Closes: #902355)
  * dh_installexamples: Ditto.
  * dh_installinfo: Ditto.
  * dh_installman: Ditto.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Fix a bug where ending debian/control on (what
    debhelper believed was) a comment line could cause debhelper
    to omit the last package listed in the file.  Thanks to
    Santiago Vila for reporting the bug. (Closes: #902748)

    value from the Build-Profiles field.  Thanks to Sven Joachim
    for reporting the bug.  (Closes: #902268)
  * debhelper.pod: Rewrite the compat 11 change on "main doc
    packages" in an attempt to clarify what is happening in
    compat 11.  Thanks to Paul Gevers for pointing out some of
    the confusing aspects.

debhelper (11.3.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * d/control: Remove versioned Breaks on qt5-qmake as it
    prevents others from backporting qt5 packages to
    stable-backports.  The Breaks was added to assist
    cross-building in buster and it has already served that
    purpose by now.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Provide a more helpful diagnostic message when
    an executable config file fails and it does not have a
    #!-line (and is not an ELF binary).  Thanks to Nadav
    Ruskin for the suggestion.  (Closes: #902214)
  * debhelper.pod: Make a dedicated subsection about executable
    debhelper config files to make them more prominent.  Thanks
    to Nadav Ruskin for the suggestion.  (Closes: #901715)
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Avoid forking a shell when running executable
    debhelper config files.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Validate package names according the rules for
    Debian packages.  Thanks to Raphael Geissert and Tim
    Düsterhus for the suggestion.  (Closes: #567178)
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Rewrite deb822 parser to validate d/control
    more strictly.  Particularly, debhelper no longer permits
    the same field twice in a stanza.  Thanks to Tim Düsterhus
    for the suggestion.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Ensure that at most once definition of
    (X-)Package-Type is used per stanza.

  [ Roberto C. Sánchez ]
  * cmake.pm: Reorder arguments to cmake to make "-D FOO=BAR"
    work.  This form only works if it is before the directory
    passed to cmake.

  [ Daniele Nicolodi ]
  * dh_installsystemd: Improve man page.
  * dh_installsystemd: Tighten error handling: fail immediately if an unit
    name not installed by the package is specified on the command line.
  * dh_installsystemd: Fix the undocumented '--no-also' command line
    option to do not affect handling of the Alias= directives.
  * dh_installsystemd: Add timer units to the list of units considered
    when the '--name' option is specified.

      + Make debhelper Conflict/Replace pkg-create-dbgsym to force it off.
      + Set DBGSYM_PACKAGE_TYPE to ddeb to get correct debian/files output.

debhelper (11.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * Buildsystem.pm: Fix use of undefined variable in certain
    error conditions.
  * dh_makeshlibs: Support -VUpstream-Version and -VNone as
    alternative to passing -V or omitting -V respectively.
  * dh_makeshlibs: Make -VUpstream-Version the default in
    compat 12 when -V is omitted.  (Closes: #896464)
  * dh_makeshlibs: Correct handling of an explicit -V when
    a source builds multiple library packages and provides
    explicit shlibs files for a subset of them.  Previously,
    the -V option could have been ignored for some of the
    packages containing libraries.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Fall back to a regular mv(1) when rename fails
    with EXDEV (cross mount point moves).  This restores
    debhelper's ability to move files between mount points,
    which can happen in dh_builddeb has to correct the
    extension of a binary package built by dpkg-deb.
    Thanks to Evan Krall for the report.  (Closes: #897569)
  * dh_missing.1: Consistently mention that dh_missing
    defaults to --list-missing in compat 12.  Thanks to
    Robie Basak for spotting the contradicting documentation.
    (Closes: #898161)
  * dh_compress:  Avoid adding a duplicate ".gz" extension on
    a symlink if it already has it.  This can happen e.g. with
    dh_installman recompresses a manpage that was compressed and
    had a valid symlink to it.  Thanks to Andreas Hasenack for
    reporting the bug.  (Closes: LP: #1765851)
  * debian/control: Depend on dwz for dh_dwz.
  * dh_dwz: Generate a per-package multifile by default.  This
    feature can be disabled by --no-dwz-multifile.
  * dh: Run dh_dwz by default in compat 12.
  * dh_dwz: Remove warning about the dwz feature being experimental.
  * dwz.pm: Ditto.
  * dh_installsystemd: Use the basename of the "tmpfiles" config
    files.  This makes "systemd-tmpfiles --create" search for it
    in both /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d and in /etc/tmpfiles.d.  With
    this change the system administrator can now override the
    "tmpfiles" config shipped by the package in
    /usr/libtmpfiles.d.  Thanks to Nick Groenen and Seyeong Kim
    for filing the bug.  (Closes: #894510)
  * dh_installinit: Ditto.
  * dh_installchangelogs: Look for changelog files installed by the
    upstream build system in the package build dir (i.e. d/<pkg>/
    and *not* debian/tmp!) and use them in preference to the one in the
    source package where available.  This avoids some cases of duplicated
    upstream changelogs.  Thanks to Evgeni Golov for the suggestion.
    (Closes: #513521)
  * dh_md5sums: Stop deleting empty md5sums files as dpkg (now) creates
    the empty file on install if absent.  Thanks to Rhonda D'Vine for
    suggesting the improvement.  (Closes: #776853)
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Re-organise exports.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Retract "print_and_complex_doit"; the only potential
    consumer went with a different code snippet.
  * dh_installinitramfs: New tool to install initramfs hook scripts and
    handle related maintscripts.  Thanks to Evgeni Golov for the
    suggestion.  (Closes: #491027)
  * installinitramfs.pm: New sequence to enable dh_installinitramfs in
    compat 11 and earlier.
  * dh_installdirs: Add --(no-)create-in-sourcedir option to make
    dh_installdirs create directories in the source directory in addition
    in the package build directory.  Furthermore, dh_installdirs now
    accepts --sourcedir to overrule the default source directory (just
    like e.g. dh_install).  Thanks to Robert Luberda for the suggestion.
    (Closes: #816332)
  * Buildsystem.pm: Move code from Dh_Buildsystems.pm to Buildsystem.pm
    to make the latter independent of the former.  This makes it possible
    to load Buildsystem.pm without debian/control being present.  Thanks
    to Andreas Tille for the bug report.  (Closes: #897026)
  * dh_installinit.1: Fix some incorrect markup in the documentation of
    --no-enable.
  * makefile.pm: Revert the use of -O/-Oline for make, which helps
    debugging what commands time out on the buildds.  Thanks to
    Adrian Bunk for the report.  (Closes: #895196)
  * dh_testroot.1: Update R³ documentation to reflect the current
    implementation and not the initial draft.  Thanks to Jens Reyer
    for reporting the inconsistency.  (Closes: #899125)
  * d/changelog: Retroactively add Closes for LP bug #1766102 in 11.2
    release.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Correct control parser to permit zero or more leading
    space after the "Section" field (instead of "exactly one" space).
  * python_distutils.pm: Deprecate the python-distutils build system
    and mark it as removed in compat 12.  Users are recommended to
    migrate to the third-party build system called "pybuild".  This
    deprecation implies that python3 (among other) will not be
    supported in the python-distutils build system.
    (Closes: #568033, #597105, #597342, #769840, #813686, #898347)

    and Tobias Frost for the reports and debugging.
    (Closes: #895174, #895181)
  * Buildsystems: Avoid choosing a build system for the clean
    step if it is not necessary.  Previously, debhelper could
    choose a "random" build system that would prefer building
    in a separate build directory on the basis that the build
    directory should be removed.  With this, change we only

    backports also work for debhelper with single integer versions.
    Thanks to Trent W. Buck for the suggestion.  (Closes: #894666)
  * makefile.pm: Use -Oline with make.  This avoids make mistaking
    a target name for a value for -O and should make build time

  * Buildsystem.pm: Rewrite to support build systems that generate
    build files for another build system (without using
    inheritance).  This enables generator build systems to have

debhelper (11.1.6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Dh_Lib: Avoid passing invalid parameters to a function, which
    caused tons of "package ARRAY(...) is not in control info"
    warnings from dh in some cases.  It triggers when dh thinks
    the package might have architecture qualified debhelper config
    files.  The warning is harmless (besides the noise) for all
    native builds and most cross builds, but it did invalidate
    attempt to make pkgfile() use "DEB_TARGET_ARCH{,_OS}"
    (see 11.1.5~alpha1).  Thanks to Andreas Beckmann for reporting
    the issue.  (Closes: #891546)
  * dh: Refactor handling of sequences to simplify some code paths.
  * autopkgtests: Remove "use-name" tests as it no longer works.
    The debhelper module makes assumptions in which directory it is
    run from and the test breaks these assumptions.
  * debian/control: Comment out versioned dependency on make.
    It is not strictly necessary for Debian and causes issues with
    make-guile.  On the other hand, it is useful for people
    backporting debhelper on derivatives and hench leaving it as a
    comment.  (Closes: #892586)
  * debian/control: Bump dependency on dh-autoreconf for the fix for
    #889567.
  * dh_installinfo: Accept --sourcedir like the documentation says
    for compat 11.  Prevently the option was incorrectly silently
    ignored.  Thanks to Nicolas Boulenguez for the report and the
    patch.  (Closes: #894226)
  * dh_ucf.1: Apply patch from Nicolas Boulenguez to add missing
    documentation of the "--all" and non-option parameters.
    (Closes: #894228)
  * dh_installxfonts: Apply patch from Nicolas Boulenguez.  This
    ensures that the generated maintscript snippets are bit-for-bit
    reproducible when a package ships xfons in multiple fonts
    directories.  (Closes: #894227)
  * Dh_Lib: Improve the "make_symlink" code to avoid non-compliant
    symlinks when the link name was not a normalized path.  Note
    that ".."-segments are now disallowed in the link name (but not
    the link target).  Thanks to Nicolas Boulenguez for reporting
    the bug plus the test cases.  (Closes: #894229)
  * dh_installinfo: Report installed files to dh_missing.  Thanks
    to Daniel Kahn Gillmor for reporting this omission.
    (Closes: #893160)
  * Dh_Lib: Make Dh_Lib loadable again without a debian/control being
    present.  This makes the autopkgtests work again.

  * dh_testroot: With the advent of DEB_RULES_REQUIRES_ROOT, it
    no longer needs to read debian/control to tell whether root
    is needed or not.  However, the warning remains for calling
    dh_testroot outside the source root (as we may need to check
    the compat level in a future version of debhelper).
  * makefile.pm: Synchronize output from make (via -O) when
    make runs in parallel except when STDOUT is a TTY.  Thanks
    to Goswin von Brederlow for the suggestion.  (Closes: #768791)
  * dh_gencontrol: Avoid uninitialized value warning when there
    are no build-ids (e.g. because the builder disabled the
    dbgsym building via DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS).  This regression
    was introduced in 11.1.  Thanks to Christian Marillat for
    reporting the bug.  (Closes: #890736)
  * Dh_Lib: pkgfile() now properly uses for DEB_TARGET_ARCH{,_OS}
    when the package is set to be built for the target
    architecture.
  * d/control: Drop dependency on binutils; it does not reflect
    our actual requirement and the package or builder will ensure
    that the current binutils is installed for other reasons
    any way.  Thanks to Helmut Grohne for the report.

    entries.
  * Use HTTPS in debian/copyright format URL.

  [ Niels Thykier ]
  * Remove support for named compat levels.
  * dh_perl: Make dh_perl faster on packages with large doc
    directories by pruning the entire doc directory.
  * dh,dh_auto_*: Support skipping all of the dh_auto_* helpers if the
    package does not seem to have a build system (and there are no build
    system related options passed to dh).
  * Dh_Lib.pm: Define a (hardcoded) extension for dbgsym packages.
  * dh_gencontrol: Pass -DPackage-Type to dpkg-gencontrol when the
    package type for dbgsym is different than for regular deb packages.
  * dh_builddeb: Automatically handle renaming of dbgsym packages when
    the extension of the dbgsym packages are different than for regular
    deb packages.
  * dh_installsystemd,dh_systemd_start: Use "restart" instead of the

    package as long as another on being acted on ships it.
  * dh_installsystemd: Optimize the search for files installed in the
    tmpfiles.d directories to only look in the tmpfiles.d directories.
  * Add experimental support for building some packages for "TARGET"
    rather than "HOST" via the X-DH-Build-For-Type field.  The field
    is subject to removal and changes without notice.  The field is
    not considered by dpkg tooling and therefore you will still have
    to manually work around tools like dpkg-gencontrol (even when
    called via dh_gencontrol).

  * dh_installmodules: Ensure maintscripts are reproducible even with
    multiple kernel versions detected.
  * Apply patches from gregor herrmann to improve autopkgtests.
  * Dh_Lib: Introduce a print_and_complex_doit.
  * Buildsystem: Introduce a complex_doit_in_builddir, which is needed
    by gradle-debian-helper.
  * Dh_Lib: Fix bug in doit + doit_* that made them fork a shell in
    some cases.  For backwards compatibility, there is detection code
    that should make it warn for this case and retain bug-compatibility.
    This can cause a weird "Please specify the compatibility level in
    debian/compat" error if the tools have chdir to a different directory.
  * Dh_Lib: Support an optional hashref in doit + doit_* to enable some
    trivial operations in the child process (e.g. redirect stdout).
  * dh_installman: Avoid forking a shell where a simple subprocess call
    is sufficient.
  * Dh_Lib: Avoid forking 2 to 7 subprocesses for adding an autosnippet
    when helper tools use a subroutine rather then a sed snippet.
  * Dh_Lib: Extend autoscript to accept a hashref and use that for
    substituting into the snippet.  This variant (like the subroutine
    variant) avoids forking a lot of subprocesses and need not worry
    about a shell possibly interpreting metacharacters.

  * Merge from Debian unstable.  Remaining changes:
    - dh_installchangelogs: Do not install upstream changelog in compat
      level 7. This floods packages with huge upstream changelogs which
      are unnecessary on an installed system.
    - Restore maintainer ability to override ddeb compression
    - Generate ddebs from debhelper instead of pkg-create-dbgsym
      + Make debhelper Conflict/Replace pkg-create-dbgsym to force it off.
      + Mirror udeb code in dh_builddeb to allow us to alter file extension.
      + Set dbgsym Package-Type to ddeb to get correct debian/files output.
      + Depend on dpkg-dev (>= 1.18.23ubuntu3) so the above works correctly.
  * Drop cherry-picks included in new release:
    - Dh_Lib: When passing -a/-i only, and there are no arch/indep packages,
      exit. This was accidentally removed when optimising a common case.

    - Revert commit 80c955221e83327efb984845f59648678c729978 from upstream. This
      causes empty override_...-{arch,indep} targets to skip the command

    Thanks, Aurelien Jarno and Bastien ROUCARIES. Closes: #631985
  * dh: Ensure -a and -i are passed when running override_dh_command-arch
    and override_dh_command-indep targets. This is needed when the binary
    target is run, rather than binary-arch/binary-indep. Closes: #648901

debhelper (8.9.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh: Now you can use override_dh_command-arch and override_dh_command-indep
    to run different overrides when building arch and indep packages. This
    allows for a much simplified form of rules file in this situation, where
    build-arch/indep and binary-arch/indep targets do not need to be manually
    specified. See man page for examples. Closes: #640965
    .
    Note that if a rules file has say, override_dh_fixperms-arch,
    but no corresponding override_dh_fixperms-indep, then the unoverridden
    dh_fixperms will be run on the indep packages.
    .
    Note that the old override_dh_command takes precidence over the new
    overrides, because mixing the two types of overrides would have been
    too complicated. In particular, it's difficult to ensure an
    old override target will work if it's sometimes constrained to only
    acting on half the packages it would normally run on. This would be
    a source of subtle bugs, so is avoided.
  * dh: Don't bother running dh_shlibdebs, dh_makeshlibs, or dh_strip
    in the binary target when all packages being acted on are indep.
  * dh: Avoid running install sequence a third time in v9 when the
    rules file has explicit binary-indep and binary-arch targets.
    Closes: #639341 Thanks, Yann Dirson for test case.
  * debhelper no longer build-depends on man-db or file, to ease bootstrapping.
  * Remove obsolete versioned dependency on perl-base.
  * Avoid writing debhelper log files in no-act mode. Closes: #640586
  * Tighten parsing of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.

  * dh_auto_test: Run cmake tests in parallel when allowed by
    DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS. (Modestas Vainius) Closes: #587885
  * dpkg-buildflags is only used to set environment in v9, to avoid
    re-breaking packages that were already broken a first time by

    when passed bundled options (like "-Nfoo" instead of "-N foo") that
    it does not understand; and it was not possible to fix that
    for any compat level before v8. But also, such logs can occur
    for other reasons, like interrupted builds during development,

debhelper (8.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Joey Hess ]
  * dh_auto_clean: Inhibit logging, so that, if dh_auto_clean is used
    in some rule other than clean, perhaps to clean up an intermediate
    build before a second build is run, debian/rules clean still runs it.
    Closes: #615553
  * Started work on Debhelper v9. It is still experimental, and more
    changes may be added to that mode.
  * Support multiarch in v9. Thanks, Steve Langasek. Closes: #617761
  * dh_auto_configure: Support multiarch in v9 by passing multiarch
    directories to --libdir and --libexecdir.
  * dh_makeshlibs: Detect packages using multiarch directories and
    make ${misc:Pre-Depends} expand to multiarch-support.
  * Depend on dpkg-dev (>= 1.16.0) for multiarch support. Note to backporters:
    If you remove that dependency, debhelper will fall back to not doing
    multiarch stuff in v9 mode, which is probably what you want.

  * Improve handling of logging in override targets, so that

  * Add deprecation warning for dh_clean -k.
  * dh_testversion: Removed this deprecated and unused command.

  * In v8 mode, do not allow directly passing unknown options to debhelper
    commands. (Unknown options in DH_OPTIONS still only result in warnings.)
  * In v8 mode, dh_makeshlibs will run dpkg-gensymbols on all shared
    libraries it generates shlibs files for. This means that -X can be
    used to exclude libraries from processing by dpkg-gensymbols. It also
    means that libraries in unusual locations, where dpkg-gensymbols does
    not itself normally look, will be passed to it, a behavior change which
    may break some packages. Closes: #557603
  * In v8 mode, dh expects the sequence to run is always its first parameter.

    This avoids ambiguities when parsing options to be passed on to debhelper
    commands. (See #570039)

  * If neither -a or -i are specified, debhelper commands used to default

debhelper (7.3.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * Modular object oriented dh_auto_* buildsystem support,
    contributed by Modestas Vainius
    - dh_auto_* --sourcedirectory can now be used to specify a source
      directory if sources and/or the whole buildsystem lives elsewhere
      than the top level directory. Closes: #530597
    - dh_auto_* --builddirectory can now be used to specify a build
      directory to use for out of source building, for build systems
      that support it. Closes: #480577
    - dh_auto_* --buildsystem can now be used to override the autodetected
      build system, or force use of a third-party class.
    - dh_auto_* --list can be used to list available and selected build
      systems.
    - Adds support for cmake.
    - For the perl_build build system, Build is used consistently
      instead of falling back to using the generated Makefile.
      Closes: #534332
    - Historical dh_auto_* behavior should be preserved despite these
      large changes..
  * Move two more command-specific options to only be accepted by the commands
    that use them. The options are:
    --sourcedir, --destdir
    If any third-party debhelper commands use either of the above options,
    they will be broken, and need to be changed to pass options to init().
  * Make dh not complain about unknown, command-specific options passed to it,
    and further suppress warnings about such options it passes on to debhelper
    commands. This was attempted incompletely before in version 7.2.17.

    via misc:Depends to handle partial upgrades. Note that while
    dh_installinfo already required that info files had a INFO-DIR-SECTION,
    the new system also requires they have START-INFO-DIR-ENTRY and

  * To avoid breaking rules files that pass options to commands that do not
    use them, debhelper will now only warn if it encounters an unknown
    option. This will be converted back to an error later.

debhelper (7.0.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release is designed to be easily backportable to stable,
    to support the new style of rules file that I expect many packages will
    use.
  * dh: debian/rules override targets can change what is run
    for a specific debhelper command in a sequence.
    (Thanks Modestas Vainius for the improved makefile parser.)
  * dh: Redid all the examples to use override targets, since these
    eliminate all annoying boilerplate and are much easier to understand
    than the old method.
  * Remove rules.simple example, there's little need to use explicit targets
    with dh anymore.
  * dh: Support debian/rules calling make with -B,
    which is useful to avoid issues with phony implicit
    rules (see bug #509756).

debhelper (7.0.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_auto_install: Rather than looking at the number of binary packages
    being acted on, look at the total number of binary packages in the
    source package when deciding whether to install to debian/package or
    debian/tmp. This avoids inconsistencies when building mixed arch all+any
    packages using the binary-indep and binary-arch targets.

    dh_shlibdeps, which both use it. (It could be changed not to, but
    it's good to have it run all the commands as a test.) Closes: #486439

debhelper (7.0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * rules.tiny: Typo fix. Closes: #479647
  * dh_installinit: Add --restart-after-upgrade, which avoids stopping a
    daemon in the prerm, and instead restarts it in the postinst, keeping
    its downtime minimal. Since some daemons could break if files are upgraded
    while they're running, it's not the default. It might become the default
    in a future (v8) compatibility level. Closes: #471060
  * dh: fix POD error. Closes: #480191
  * dh: Typo fixes. Closes: #480200
  * dh: Add remove_command to the sequence interface.
  * dh_auto_clean: setup.py clean can create pyc files. Remove. Closes: #481899

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 19 May 2008 12:47:47 -0400

debhelper (7.0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh: Add an interface that third-party packages providing debhelper commands
    can use to insert them into a command sequence.
    (See dh(1), "SEQUENCE ADDONS".)
  * dh: --with=foo can be used to include such third-party commands.
    So, for example, --with=cli could add the dh_cli* commands from
    cli-common.
  * Moved python-support special case out of dh and into a python-support
    sequence addon. --with=python-support is enabled by default to avoid
    breaking backwards compatibility.

debhelper (7.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh: Fix man page typos. Closes: #477933
  * Add missing $! to error message when the log can't be opened.
  * One problem with the log files is that if dh_clean is not the last command
    run, they will be left behind. This is a particular problem on build
    daemons that use real root. Especially if cdbs is used, since it runs
    dh_listpackages after clean, thereby leaving behind log files that
    only root can touch. Avoid this particular special case by inhibiting
    logging by dh_listpackages.

    run and there are no packages of that type.
  * dh_auto_configure: Set PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT when configuring MakeMaker
    packages to avoid interactive prompts.
  * dh_auto_*: Also support packages using Module::Build.
  * dh_auto_*: Fix some calls to setup.py. Now tested and working with
    python packages.
  * dh_install: Find all possible cases of "changelog" and "changes", rather
    than just looking for some predefined common cases.

    and the package is not native, guess at a few common changelog filenames.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Apr 2008 00:16:19 -0400

debhelper (7.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh: New program that runs a series of debhelper commands in a sequence.
    This can be used to construct very short rules files (as short as 3
    lines), while still exposing the full power of debhelper when it's
    needed.
  * dh_auto_configure: New program, automates running ./configure,
    Makefile.PL, and python distutils. Calls them with exactly the same
    options as cdbs does by default, and allows adding/overriding options.
  * dh_auto_build: New program, automates building the package by either
    running make or using setup.py. (Support for cmake and other build systems
    planned but not yet implemented.)
  * dh_auto_test: New program, automates running make test or make check
    if the Makefile has such a target.
  * dh_auto_clean: New program, automates running make clean (or distclean,
    or realclean), or using setup.py to clean up.
  * dh_auto_install: New program, automates running make install, or using
    setup.py to install. Supports the PREFIX=/usr special case needed by
    MakeMaker Makefiles. (Support for cmake and other build systems planned
    but not yet implemented.)
  * New v7 mode, which only has three changes from v6, and is the new
    recommended default, especially when using dh.
  * dh_install: In v7 mode, if --sourcedir is not specified, first look for
    files in debian/tmp, and then will look in the current directory. This
    allows dh_install to interoperate with dh_auto_install without needing any
    special parameters.
  * dh_clean: In v7 mode, read debian/clean and delete all files listed
    therein.
  * dh_clean: In v7 mode, automatically delete *-stamp files.
  * Add a Makefile and simplify this package's own rules file using
    all the new toys.
  * dh_clean: Don't delete core dumps. (Too DWIM, and "core" is not
    necessarily a core dump.) Closes: #477391
  * dh_prep: New program, does the same as dh_clean -k (which will be
    deprecated later).

    The time stamp information need not be contained in the .gz file since the
    time stamp is preserved when compressing and decompressing. Closes: #467100
  * The order of dependencies generated by debhelper has been completly random
    (hash key order), so sort it. Closes: #468959

debhelper (6.0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_link: -X can be used to avoid it modifying symlinks to be compliant
    with policy. Closes: #461392
  * dh_shlibdeps: Rather than skipping everything in /usr/lib/debug,
    which can include debug libraries that dpkg-shlibdeps should look at,
    only skip the subdirectories of it that contain separate debugging
    symbols. (Hardcoding the names of those directories is not the best

  * dh_gencontrol: Stop passing -isp, it's the default now. Closes: #458114
  * dh_shlibdeps: Update documentation for -L and -l. dpkg-shlibdeps is now
    much smarter, and these options are almost never needed. Closes: #459226
  * dh_shlibdeps: If a relative path is specified in -l, don't prepend the pwd
    to it, instead just prepend a slash to make it absolute. dpkg-shlibdeps
    has changed how it used LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so making it point into the
    package build directory won't work.
  * dh_shlibdeps: Change "-L pkg" to cause "-Sdebian/pkg" to be passed to
    dpkg-shlibdeps. The old behavior of passing -L to dpkg-shlibdeps didn't
    affect where it looked for symbols files. Closes: #459224
  * Depend on dpkg-dev 1.14.15, the first to support dpkg-shlibdeps -S.
  * dh_installdocs, dh_installexamples: Support files with spaces in exclude
    mode. Closes: #459426

  * dh_installudev: Don't fail if the link already somehow exists on initial
    package install. Closes: #415717
  * prerm and postrm scripts are now generated in a reverse order than
    preinst and postinst scripts. For example, if a package uses
    dh_pysupport before dh_installinit, the prerm will first stop the init
    script and then remove the python files.
  * Introducing beginning of v6 mode.
  * dh_installwm: In v6 mode, install a slave manpage link for
    x-window-manager.1.gz. Done in v6 mode because some window managers
    probably work around this longstanding debhelper bug by registering the
    slave on their own. This bug was only fixable once programs moved out of
    /usr/X11R6. Closes: #85963
  * dh_builddeb: In v6 mode, fix bug in DH_ALWAYS_EXCLUDE handling, to work
    the same as all the other code in debhelper. This could only be fixed in
    v6 mode because packages may potentially legitimately rely on the old
    buggy behavior. Closes: #242834

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Update of dh_python
    - vastly refactored, easier to understand, and the difference
      between old policy and new policy is easier to grasp
    - it supports an -X option which can be used to not scan some files
    - uses debian/pyversions as reference source of information for
      dependencies but also parse the XS-Python-Version header as fallback.
    - ${python:Versions}'s default value is XS-Python-Version's value
      instead of "all" when the package doesn't depend on a
      specific python version. Closes: #373853
    - always generate ${python:Provides} and leave the responsibility to the
      maintainer to not use ${python:Provides} if he doesn't want the
      provides.
    - uses debian/pycompat or DH_PYCOMPAT as reference field to run in new
      policy mode. The presence of XS-Python-Version will also trigger the
      new policy mode (this is for short-term compatibility, it may be removed in
      the not too-distant future).
      DH_PYCOMPAT=1 is the default mode and is compatible to the old policy.
      DH_PYCOMPAT=2 is the new mode and is compatible with the new policy.
  * Use "grep ^Version:" instead of "grep Version:" on the output of

  * debhelper v5 mode is finalised and the new recommended compatibility
    level. Unless your package uses dh_strip --dbg-package, switching to v5
    is 99.999% unlikely to change anything in a package, and it allows
    adding comments to all your debhelper config files, so I recommend making
    the switch as soon as this version reaches testing.

debhelper (4.0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make dh_installchangelogs install debian/NEWS files as well, as
    NEWS.Debian. Make dh_compress always compress them. The idea is to make
    these files be in a machine parsable form, like the debian changelog, but
    only put newsworthy info into them. Automated tools can then display new
    news on upgrade. It is hoped that if this catches on it will reduce the
    abuse of debconf notes. See discussion on debian-devel for details.

debhelper (4.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles has long been a sore point in debhelper. Inherited
    from debstd, its interface and implementation suck, and I have maintained
    it while never really deigning to use it. Now there is a remplacment:
    dh_install, which ...
    - copies files, doesn't move them. Closes: #75360, #82649
    - doesn't have that whole annoying debian/package.files vs. debian/files
      mess, as it uses debian/install.
    - supports copying empty subdirs. Closes: #133037
    - doesn't use tar, thus no error reproting problems. Closes: #112538
    - files are listed relative to the pwd, debian/tmp need not be used at
      all, so no globbing issues. Closes: #100404
    - supports -X. Closes: #116902
    - the whole concept of moving files out of a directory is gone, so this
      bug doesn't really apply. Closes: #120026
    - This is exactly what Bill Allombert asked for in #117383, even though I
      designed it seemingly independantly. Thank you Bill! Closes: #117383
  * Made debhelper's debian/rules a lot simpler by means of the above.
  * Updated example rules file to use dh_install. Also some reordering and
    other minor changes.
  * dh_movefiles is lightly deprecated, and when you run into its bugs and
    bad design, you are incouraged to just use dh_install instead.
  * dh_fixperms: in v4 only, make all files in bin/ dirs +x. Closes: #119039
  * dh_fixperms: in v4 only, make all files in etc/init.d executable (of
    course there's -X ..)
  * dh_link: in v4 only, finds existing, non-policy-conformant symlinks
    and corrects them. This has the side effect of making dh_link idempotent.
  * Added a -h/--help option. This seems very obvious, but it never occured to
    me before..
  * use v4 for building debhelper itself
  * v4 mode is done, you may now use it without fear of it changing.
    (This idea of this upload is to get v4 into woody so people won't run into
    many issues backporting from sarge to woody later on. Packages targeted
    for woody should continue to use whatever compatibility level they are
    using.)

debhelper (3.4.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Thanks to Benjamin Drieu <benj@debian.org>, dh_installdocs -X now works.
    I had to modify his patch to use cp --parents, since -P spews warnings
    now. Also, I made it continue to use cp -a if nothing is excluded,
    which is both faster, and means this patch is less likely to break
    anything if it turns out to be buggy. Also, stylistic changes.

debhelper (3.4.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Introduced the debian/compat file. This is the new, preferred way to say
    what debhelper compatibility level your package uses. It has the big
    advantage of being available to debhelper when you run it at the command
    line, as well as in debian/rules.
  * A new v4 feature: dh_installinit, in v4 mode, will use invoke-rc.d.
    This is in v4 for testing, but I may well roll it back into v3 (and
    earlier) once woody is released and I don't have to worry about breaking
    things (and, presumably, once invoke-rc.d enters policy).
  * Some debhelper commands will now build up a new substvars variable,
    ${misc:Depends}, based on things they know your package needs to depend
    on. For example, dh_installinit in v4 mode adds sysvinit (>= 2.80-1) to
    that dep list, and dh_installxfonts adds a dep on xutils. This variable
    should make it easier to keep track of what your package needs to depends
    on, supplimenting the ${shlibs:Depends} and ${perl:Depends} substvars.
    Hmm, this appears to be based loosely on an idea by Masato Taruishi
    <taru@debian.org>, filtered through a long period of mulling it over.
    Closes: #76352
  * Use the addsubstvar function I wrote for the above in dh_perl too.

    - However, if you really want to, you can skip the dep, and the
      postinst will avoid running program that arn't available. Closes: #131053
    - Use update-fonts-dir instead of handling encodings ourselves. Yay!
    - Pass only the last component of the directory name to
      update-fonts-*, since that's what they perfer now.
    - Other changes, chould fully comply with Debian X font policy now.

debhelper (3.4.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Began work on v4 support (and thus the large version number jump), and it
    is only for the very brave right now since I will unhesitatingly break
    compatibility in v4 mode as I'm developing it. Currently, updating to v4
    mode will only make dh_makeshlibs -V generate shared library deps that
    omit the debian part of the version number. The reasoning behind this
    change is that the debian revision should not typically break binary
    compatibility, that existing use of -V is causing too tight versioned
    deps, and that if you do need to include the debian revision for some
    reason, you can always write it out by hand. Closes: #101497
  * dh_testversion is deprecated -- use build deps instead. A warning message
    is now output when it runs. Currently used by: 381 packages.
  * dh_installxaw is deprecated -- xaw-wrappers in no longer in the

  * dh_gencontrol: Added a documented interface for specifying substvars
    data in a file. Substvars data may be put in debian/package.substvars.
    (Those files used to be used by debhelper for automatically generated
    data, but it uses a different internal filename now). It will be merged
    with any automatically determined substvars data. See bug #98819
  * I want to stress that no one should ever rely in internal, undocumented
    debhelper workings. Just because debhelper uses a certian name for some
    internally used file does not mean that you should feel free to modify
    that file to your own ends in a debian package. If you do use it, don't
    be at all suprised when it breaks. If you find that debhelper is lacking
    a documented interface for something that you need, ask for it!

debhelper (3.0.27) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed issues with extended parameters to dh_gencontrol including spaces
    and quotes. This was some histirical cruft that deals with splitting up
    the string specified by -u, and it should not have applied to the set
    of options after --. Now that it's fixed, any and all programs that
    support a -- and options after it, do not require any special quoting
    of the succeeding options. Quote just like you would in whatever
    program those options go to. So, for example,
    dh_gencontrol -Vblah:Depends='foo, bar (>= 1.2)' will work just as you
    would hope. This fix does NOT apply to -u; don't use -u if you must do
    something complex. Closes: #89311

  * Continues to depend on lynx for html changelog conversions. Yes, these
    and packages with translated debconf templates are rather rare, but
    it makes more sense for debhelper to consistently depend on all utilities
    it uses internally rather than force people to keep their dependancies
    up to date with debhelper internals. If I decide tomorrow that w3m is
    the better program to use to format html changelogs, I can make the
    change and packages don't need to update their build dependancies.

debhelper (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installman, a new program that replaces dh_installmanpages.
    It is not DWIM. You tell it what to install and it figures out where
    based on .TH section field and filename extension. I reccommend everyone
    begin using it, since this is much better then dh_installmanpages's
    evilness. I've been meaning to do this for a very long time..
    Closes: #38673, #53964, #64297, #16933, #17061, #54059, #54373, #61816
  * dh_installmanpages remains in the package for backwards compatibility,
    but is mildly deprecated.
  * dh_testversion is deprecated; use build dependancies instead.
  * dh_suidregister: re-enabled. Aj thinks that requiring people to stop
    using it is unacceptable. Who am I to disagree with a rc bug report?
    Closes: #84910 It is still deprecated, and it will still whine at you
    if you use it. I appreciate the job everyone has been doing at
    switching to statoverrides..
  * Since dh_debstd requires dh_installmanpages (where do you think the
    latter's evil interface came from?), I have removed it. It was a nice
    thought-toy, but nobody really used it, right?
  * Since the from-debstd document walks the maintainer through running
    dh_debstd to get a list of debhelper commands, and since that document
    has really outlives its usefullness, I removed it too. Use dh-make
    instead.
  * dh_installman installs only into /usr/share/man, not the X11R6
    directory. Policy says "files must not be installed into
    `/usr/X11R6/bin/', `/usr/X11R6/lib/', or `/usr/X11R6/man/' unless this
    is necessary for the package to operate properly", and I really doubt
    a man page being in /usr/share/man is going to break many programs.
    Closes: #81853 (I hope the bug submitter doesn't care that
    dh_installmanpages still puts stuff in the X11R6/man directory.)
  * dh_undocumented now the same too now.
  * dh_installinit: installs debian/package.default files as /etc/default/
    files.
  * Updated to current perl coding standards (use strict, lower-case
    variable names, pod man pages).
  * Since with the fixing of the man page installer issue, my checklist for
    debhelper v3 is complete, I pronounce debhelper v3 done! Revved the
    version number appropriatly (a large jump; v3 changes less than I had
    planned). Note that I have no plans for a v4 at this time. :-)
  * Testing: I have used this new version of debhelper to build a large
    number of my own packages, and it seems to work. But this release
    touches every file in this package, so be careful out there..

  * suidmanager is obsolete now, and so is dh_suidmanager. Instead,
    packages that contain suid binaries should include the binaries suid in
    the .deb, and dpkg-statoverride can override this. If this is done
    to a program that previously used suidmanager, though, you need to
    conflict with suidmanager (<< 0.50).
  * Made dh_suidmanager check to see if it would have done anything before.
    If so, it states that it is obsolete, and refer users to the man
    page, which now explains the situation, and then aborts the build.
    If it would have done nothing before, it just outputs a warning that
    it is an obsolete program.

      Patch from Masato Taruishi <taru@debian.org> (modified). If you

    - dh_installdeb now causes all files in /etc to be registered as
      conffiles.
    - debian/README is now supported: it is treated exactly like
      debian/README.Debian. Either file is installed as README.Debian in
      non-native packages, and now as just README in native packages.

debhelper (2.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * I started work on debhelper v2 over a year ago, with a long list of
    changes I hoped to get in that broke backwards compatibility. That
    development stalled after only the most important change was made,
    although I did get out over 100 releases in the debhelper 2.0.x tree.
    In the meantime, lots of packages have switched to using v2, despite my
    warnings that doing so leaves packages open to being broken without
    notice until v2 is complete.
  * Therefore, I am calling v2 complete, as it is. Future non-compatible
    changes will happen in v3, which will be started soon. This means that
    by using debhelper v2, one major thing changes: debhelper uses
    debian/<package> as the temporary directory for *all* packages;
    debian/tmp is no longer used to build binary packages out of. This is
    very useful for multi-binary packages, and I reccommend everyone
    switch to v2.
  * Updated example rules files to use v2 by default.
  * Updated all documentation to assume that v2 is being used.
  * Added a few notes for people still using v1.
  * Moved all of the README into debhelper(1).

    update-alternatives. Closes: #52156, #34684 (latter bug is obsolete)
  * Fixed $dh{flavor} to be upper-case.
  * Deprecated dh_installemavcsen --number; use --priority instead. Also,
    the option parser requires the parameter be a number now. And,
    dh_installwm now accepts --priority, and window manager packages should
    start using it.
  * dh_installwm now behaves like a proper debhelper command, and reads
    debian/<package>.wm too. This is a small behavior change; filenames
    specified on the command line no longer apply to all packages it acts
    on. I can't believe this program existed for 2 years with such a glaring
    problem; I guess most people don't need ot register 5 wm's in 3
    sub-packages. Anyway, it can handle such things now. :-)

    hard links, and was suid, suidregister detected all the hard links as
    files that need to be registered. It looped, registering the first
    link, and then removing its suid bit. This messed up the registration
    of the other had links, since their permissions were now changed,
    leading to unpredictable results. The fix is to just not remove suid
    bits until all files have been registered.

    - This also Closes: #37092 come to think of it.
  * dh_shlibdeps, dh_shlibdeps.1:
    - Added -X option, which makes it not examine some files. This is
      useful in rare cases. Closes: #51100
    - Always pass "-dDepends" before the list of files, which makes it

     - dh_installdebfiles is no longer a part of debhelper. This affects

    (Closes: #51099)
  * Dh_Getopt.pm: Modified it so any options specified after -- are added to

  * Added new dh_installxfonts script by Changwoo Ryu
    <cwryu@dor17988.kaist.ac.kr>. Closes: #46684
    I made some changes, though:
    - I rewrote lots of this script to be more my style of perl.
    - I removed all the verbisity from the postinst script fragment, since
      that is a clear violation of policy.
    - I made the postinst fail if the mkfontdir, etc commands fail, because
      this really makes more sense. Consider idempotency.
    - I moved the test to see if the font dir is really a directory into the
      dh_ script and out of the snippet. If the maintainer plays tricks on
      us, mkfontdir will blow up satisfactorally anyway.
    - So, the snippet is 9 lines long now, down from 20-some.
    - I realize this isn't following the reccommendations made in Brando^Hen's
      font policy. I'll fight it out with him. :-)
    - In postrm fragment, used rmdir -p to remove as many parent directories
      as I can.

    though it's now uglier. Closes: 46287
  * examples/*: It's important that one -not- use a install-stamp target.
    Install should run every time binary-* calls it. Otherwise if a binary-*
    target is called twice by hand, you get duplicate entries in the

debhelper (2.0.40) unstable; urgency=low

  * FHS complience. Patch from Johnie Ingram <johnie@netgod.net>.
    For the most part, this was a straight-forward substitution,
    dh_installmanpages needed a non-obvious change though.
  * Closes: #42489, #42587, #41732.
  * dh_installdocs: Adds code to postinst and prerm as specified in
    http://www.debian.org/Lists-Archives/debian-ctte-9908/msg00038.html,
    to make /usr/doc/<package> a compatibility symlink to
    /usr/share/doc/<package>. Note that currently if something exists in
    /usr/doc/<package> when the postinst is run, it will silently not make
    the symlink. I'm considering more intellingent handing of this case.
  * Note that if you build a package with this version of debhelper, it will
    use /usr/share/man, /usr/share/doc, and /usr/share/info. You may need to
    modify other files in your package that reference the old locations.

debhelper (2.0.30) unstable; urgency=low

  * It turns out it's possible to set up make variables that are specific to
    a single target of a Makefile. This works tremendously well with
    DH_OPTIONS: no need to put "-i" or "-pfoo" after every debhelper command
    anymore.
  * debhelper.1: mentioned above technique.
  * examples/rules.multi: use the above method to get rid of -i's and -a's.
  * examples/rules.multi2: new file, example of a multi-binary package that
    works for arch-indep and arch-dependant packages, and also allows
    building of single binary packages independntly, via binary-<package>
    targets. It accomplishes all this using only one list of debhelper
    commands.
  * examples/*: removed source and diff targets. They've been obsolete for 2

  * Skip CVS dir when running tests.
  * Since CVS is so brain dead about symlinks, added a debian/fixlinks script.
    Modified debian/rules to make sure it's run if any of the symlinks are

debhelper (2.0.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * Dh_lib.pm: when looking for debhelper files in debian/, test with -f,

debhelper (2.0.15) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (2.0.09) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: added some FHS support. Though debhelper doesn't put stuff

    various files in /usr/share/{man,doc,info}. (Closes: #40892)

debhelper (2.0.04) unstable; urgency=low

  * Patch from Raphael Hertzog <rhertzog@hrnet.fr> to make dh_perl support a

    barely. That's what all the zero's mean. :-)
  * If DH_COMPAT=2, then debian/<package> will be used for the temporary
    build directory for all packages. debian/tmp is no more! (Well, except
    dh_movefiles still uses it.)
  * debhelper.1: documented this.
  * Dh_lib.pm: added compat(), pass in a number, it returns true if the
    current compatibility level is equal to that number.
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: documented that.
  * debhelper itself now builds using DH_COMPAT=2.
  * dh_debstd forces DH_COMPAT=1, because it needs to stay compatible with
    debstd after all.

debhelper (1.2.82) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installinit: applied patch from Yann Dirson <ydirson@multimania.com>
    to make it look for init.d scripts matching the --init-script parameter.
    This is only useful if, like Yann, you have packages that need to install

debhelper (1.2.76) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: Do not use chmod/chown -R at all anymore, instead it uses
    the (slower) find then chown method. Necessary because the -R methods will
    happyily attempt to chown a dangling symlink, which makes them fail.

  * Started writing a regression test suite for debhelper. Currently covers
    only the above bugfix and a few more dh_link tests.

debhelper (1.2.53) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: leave .taz and .tgz files alone. Previously trying to
    compress such files caused gzip to fail and the whole command to fail.
    Probably fixes #35677. Actually, it now skips files with a whole
    range of odd suffixes that gzip refuses to compress, including "_z" and
    "-gz".
  * dh_compress.1: updated docs to reflect this, and to give the new
    suggested starting point if you want to write your own debian/compress

debhelper (1.2.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * autoscripts/*menu*: It turns out that "command" is like test -w, it will
    still return true if update-menus is not executable. This can
    legitimatly happen if you are upgrading the menu package, and it makes
    postinsts that use command fail. Reverted to using test -x. Packages
    built with debhelper >= 1.2.21 that use menus should be rebuilt.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 16 Jan 1999 13:47:16 -0800

debhelper (1.2.24) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: linux 2.1.x and 2.2.x differ from earlier versions in that
    they do not clear the suid bit on a file when the owner of that file
    changes. It seems that fakeroot behaves the same as linux 2.1 here. I
    was relying on the old behavior to get rid of suid and sgid bits on files.
    Since this no longer happens implicitly, I've changed to clearing the
    bits explicitly.
  * There's also a small behavior change involved here. Before, dh_fixperms
    did not clear suid permissions on files that were already owned by root.
    Now it does.
  * dh_fixperms.1: cleaned up the docs to mention that those bits are
    cleared.

debhelper (1.2.21) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: Added doc-base support, if debian/<package>.doc-base
    exists, it will be installed as a doc-base control file. If you use this,
    you probably want to add "dh_testversion 1.2.21" to the rules file to make
    sure your package is built with a new enough debhelper.
  * dh_installdocs: now supports -n to make it not modify postinst/prerm.
  * dh_suidregister: turned off leading 0/1 in permissions settings, until
    suidregister actually supports it.
  * autoscripts/*: instead of "text -x", use "command -v" to see if various
    binaries exist. This gets rid of lots of hard-coded paths.

debhelper (1.2.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_listpackages: new command. Takes the standard options taken by other
    debhelper commands, and just outputs a list of the binary packages a
    debhelper command would act on. Added because of bug #30626, and because
    of wn's truely ugly use of debhelper internals to get the same info (and
    because it's just 4 lines of code ;-).
  * dh_compress: is now smart about compressing files that are hardlinks.
    When possible, will only compress one file, delete the hardlinks, and
    re-make hardlinks to the compressed file, saving some disk space.

debhelper (1.2.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: relaxed regexp to find library name and number a little so
    it will work on libraries with a major but no minor version in their
    filename (examples of such: libtcl8.0.so.1, libBLT-unoff.so.1)
  * dh_movefiles: added --sourcedir option to make it move files out of

    BTW).
  * manpages: updated policy version numbers.
  * dh_installdocs: behavior change: all docs are now installed mode 644.
    I have looked and it doesn't seem this will actually affect any packages
    in debian. This is useful only if you want to use dh_installdocs and not
    dh_fixperms, and that's the only time this behavior change will have any
    effect, either. (#30118)

    reason is this: if you're using suidmanager, and you want a file that
    ships suid to never be suid on your system, shipping it suid in the .deb
    will create a window where it is suid before suidmanager fixes it's
    permissions. This change should be transparent to users and developers.

  * Added support for register-window-manager command which will be in a new
    (as yet unreleased) xbase. Now a new dh_installwm program handles
    registration of a window manager and the necessary modifications to
    postinst and postrm. It's safe to go ahead and start using this for your
    window manager packages, just note that it won't do anything until the new
    xbase is out, and that due to the design of register-window-manager, if
    your wm is installed before a xbase that supports register-window-manager
    is installed, the window manager will never be registered. (#20971)

debhelper (1.1.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_strip: on Richard Braakman's advice, strip the .comment and .note
    sections of shared libraries.
  * Added DH_OPTIONS environment variable - anything in it will be treated
    as additional command line arguments by all debhelper commands. This in
    useful in some situations, for example, if you need to pass -p to all
    debhelper commands that will be run. If you use DH_OPTIONS, be sure to
    use dh_testversion 1.1.17 - older debhelpers will ignore it and do
    things you don't want them to.
  * Made -N properly exclude packages when no -i, -a, or -p flags are
    present. It didn't before, which was a bug.

  * dh_fixperms: remove execute bits from static libraries as well as
    shared libraries. (#26414)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  4 Sep 1998 14:46:37 -0700

debhelper (1.1.15) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_installmanpages: the new perl version had a nasty habit of
    installing .so.x library files as man pages. Fixed.
  * dh_installmanpages: the code to exclude searching for man pages in
    debian/tmp directories was broken. Fixed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 31 Aug 1998 00:05:17 -0700

debhelper (1.1.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Debhelper now has a web page at http://kitenet.net/programs/debhelper/

  * Added code to debian/rules to update the web page when I release new
    debhelpers.
  * dh_compress: since version 0.88 or so, dh_compress has bombed out if
    a debian/compress file returned an error code. This was actually
    unintentional - in fact, the debian/compress example in the man page
    will fail this way if usr/info or usr/X11R6 is not present. Corrected
    the program to not fail. (#26214)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Aug 1998 22:15:44 -0700

debhelper (1.1.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: rewritten in perl. Allows me to fix bug #26221 (long
    symlink problem after .so conversion), and is about twice as fast.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 29 Aug 1998 22:06:06 -0700

debhelper (1.1.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: forgot to pass package name to isnative(). Any native
    debian package that had a debian/TODO would have it installed with the
    wrong name, and debhelper would warn of undefined values for some
    packages. Fixed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Aug 1998 12:35:42 -0700

debhelper (1.1.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installchangelogs: added -k flag, that will make it install a symlink
    to the original name of the upstream changelog.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Aug 1998 15:40:40 -0700

debhelper (1.1.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * It's come to my attention that a few packages use filename globbing in
    debian/{docs,examples,whatever} files and expect that to work. It used
    to work before the perl conversion, but it was never _documented_, or
    intented to work. If you use this in your packages, they are broken and
    need fixing (and will refuse to build with current versions of debhelper).
    I apologize for the inconvenience.

  * dh_clean: fixed a bug, intorduced in version 1.1.8, where it didn't
    remove debian/files properly.
  * dh_shlibdeps, dh_testdir, dh_testroot, dh_testversion: converted to perl.
  * Encode the version of debhelper in a sepererate file, so dh_testversion
    doesn't have to be generated when a new version of debhelper is built.
  * Removed bogus menu file.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 17 Aug 1998 14:15:17 -0700

debhelper (1.1.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: has been removing the +x bits of all doc/*/examples/* files
    since version 0.97 or so. Fixed.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 16 Aug 1998 17:11:48 -0700

debhelper (1.1.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Dh_Lib.pm: made U_PARAMS an array of parameters.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: fixed bug in the escaping code, numbers don't need to be
    escaped. Also, no longer escape "-".
  * dh_clean, dh_gencontrol, dh_installcron: converted to perl.
  * dh_gencontrol.1, dh_gencontrol: the man page had said that
    --update-rcd-params was equivilant to -u for this program. You should
    really use --dpkg-gencontrol-params.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Aug 1998 14:07:35 -0700

debhelper (1.1.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/rules.multi: moved dh_movefiles into the install section.
  * doc/README: Added a note explaining why above change was necessary.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: escape_shell(): now escapes the full range of special
    characters recognized by bash (and ksh). Thanks to Branden Robinson
    <branden@purdue.edu> for looking that up.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Aug 1998 23:32:05 -0700

debhelper (1.1.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: don't die on symlinks (#25642). (Hope I got the fix right
    this time..)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Aug 1998 20:11:13 -0700

debhelper (1.1.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_builddeb, dh_installchangelogs: converted to perl.
  * dh_installdirs: converted to perl, getting rid of nasty chdir en-route.
  * dh_installdirs: now you can use absolute directory names too if you
    prefer.
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: updated to cover new perl modules.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: doit(): when printing out commands that have run, escape
    metacharacters in the output. I probably don't escape out all the
    characters I should, but this is just a convenience to the user anyway.
  * dh_installdebfiles: it's been broken forever, I fixed it. Obviously
    nobody uses it anymore, which is good, since it's deprected :-)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Aug 1998 15:23:34 -0700

debhelper (1.1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: fixed bug introduced in 1.1.1 where it would fail in some
    cases if you tried to move a broken symlink.
  * dh_installdocs: was only operating on the first package.
  * dh_installexamples: rewritten in perl.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: all multiple package operations were broken.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: implemented complex_doit() and autoscript().
  * Made all perl code work with use strict and -w (well, except
    dh_getopt.pl, but that's a hack that'll go away one day).
  * I didn't realize, but rewriting dh_installdocs in perl fixed bug #24686
    (blank lines in debian/docs file problem), although this same problem
    applies to other debhelper programs... like dh_installexamples, which had
    the same bug fixed when I rewrote it in perl just now.
  * Dh_Lib.pm: accidentially didn't check DH_VERBOSE if commands were not
    passed any switches.
  * Dh_Getopt.pm: --noscripts was broken.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 11 Aug 1998 12:44:04 -0700

debhelper (1.1.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums: -x was broken since version 1.1.1 - fixed.
  * dh_lib: removed get_arch_indep_packages() function that hasn't been used
    at all for a long while.
  * Added Dh_Lib.pm, a translation of dh_lib into perl.
  * dh_getopt.pl: moved most of it into new Dh_Getopt.pm module, rewriting
    large chunks in the process.
  * dh_installdocs: completly rewritten in perl. Now it's faster and it can
    install many oddly named files it died on before.
  * dh_installdocs: fixed a bug that installed TODO files mode 655 in native
    debian packages.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Aug 1998 15:01:15 -0700

debhelper (1.1.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_strip: added -X to specify files to not strip (#25590).
  * Added dh_installemacsen, for automatic registration with emacsen-common
    (#21401).
  * Preliminary thoughts in TODO about converting entire debhelper programs
    to perl programs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Aug 1998 13:35:17 -0700

debhelper (1.1.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: try to move all files specified, and only then bomb out if
    some of the file could not be found. Makes it easier for some packages
    that don't always have the same files in them.
  * dh_compress: any parameters passed to it on the command line specify
    additional files to be compressed in the first package acted on.
  * dh_compress: recognize standard -A parameter.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Aug 1998 22:48:01 -0700

debhelper (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New unstable branch of debhelper.

  * TODO: list all current bugs, in order I plan to tackle them.
  * Added debhelper.1 man page, which groups all the debhelper options that
    are common to all commands in once place so I can add new options w/o
    updating 27 man pages.
  * dh_*.1: updated all debheper man pages to refer to debhelper(1) where
    appropriate. Also corrected a host of little errors.
  * doc/README: moved a lot of this file into debhelper.1.
  * dh_*: -N option now excludes a package from the list of packages the
    programs act on. (#25247)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Aug 1998 17:49:56 -0700

debhelper (1.0) stable unstable; urgency=low

  * 1.0 at last!

  * This relelase is not really intended for stable. I throw a copy into
    stable-updates because I want it to be available as an upgrade for
    people using debian 2.0 (the current version in debian 2.0 has no
    critical bugs, but this version is of course a lot nicer), and I plan
    to start work on a new branch of debhelper that will fix many wishlist
    bug reports, and of course introduce many new bugs, and which will go
    into unstable only.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat,  8 Aug 1998 17:33:20 -0700

debhelper (0.99.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_debstd: only warn about scripts that actually lack #DEBHELPER#.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  7 Aug 1998 12:06:28 -0700

debhelper (0.99.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: Fixed a over-eager sanity check introduced in the last
    version.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  3 Aug 1998 18:31:45 -0700

debhelper (0.99.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: allow passing of files to move on the command line. Only
    rarely does this make sense. (#25197)

debhelper (0.99.1) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.99) unstable; urgency=low

  * !!!! WARNING: Debhelper (specifically dh_compress) is broken with
    !!!! libtricks. Use fakeroot instead until this is fixed.
  * dh_compress: applied patch from Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
    to make it not fail if there are no candidates for compression (#24654).
  * Removed a whole debhelper-0.96 tree that had crept into the source
    package by accident.
  * Is version 1.0 next?

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 16 Jul 1998 10:03:21 -0700

debhelper (0.98) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: isnative: pass -l<changelog> to dpkg-parsechangelog, to support
    odd packages with multiple different debian changelogs.
  * doc/PROGRAMMING: cleaned up the docs on DH_EXCLUDE_FIND.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Jul 1998 12:45:13 -0700

debhelper (0.97) unstable; urgency=low

  * doc/from-debstd: fixed a typo.
  * examples/*: install-stamp no longer depends on phony build targey; now
    install-stamp depends on build-stamp instead (#24234).
  * dh_fixperms: applied patch from Herbert Xu <herbert@gondor.apana.org.au>
    to fix bad uses of the find command, so it should now work on packages
    with files with spaces in them (#22005). It's also much cleaner. Thanks,
    Herbert!
  * dh_getopt.pl, doc/PROGRAMMING: added DH_EXCLUDE_FIND, to make the above
    fix work.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  5 Jul 1998 18:09:25 -0700

debhelper (0.96) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: fixed serious breakage introduced in the last version.
  * dh_movefiles: really order all symlinks last.
  * some minor reorganization of the source tree.

debhelper (0.95) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_movefiles: move even very strangly named files. (#23775) Unfortunatly,
    I had to use a temporary file. Oh well..

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Jun 1998 17:16:17 -0700

debhelper (0.94) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums: fixed so it handles spaces and other odd characters in
    filenames correctly. (#23046, #23700, #22010)
  * As a side effect, got rid of the nasty temporary file dh_md5sums used
    before.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Jun 1998 16:14:42 -0700

debhelper (0.93) unstable; urgency=low

  * Depend on file, since several dh_*'s use it.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Jun 1998 21:43:51 -0700

debhelper (0.92) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_gencontrol: pass -isp to dpkg-gencontrol to make it include section
    and priority info in the .deb file. Back in Jan 1998, this came up, and
    a consensus was reached on debian-devel that it was a good thing for
    -isp to be used.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 19 Jun 1998 16:15:24 -0700

debhelper (0.91) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdocs: support debian/<package>.{README.Debian,TODO}

debhelper (0.90) unstable; urgency=low

  * I'd like to thank Len Pikulski and Igor Grobman at nothinbut.net for
    providing me with free internet access on a moment's notice, so I could
    get this package to you after hacking on it all over New England for the
    past week. Thanks, guys!
  .
  * Added dh_debstd, which mimics the functionality of the debstd command.
    It's not a complete nor an exact copy, and it's not so much intended to
    be used in a debian/rules file, as it is to be run by hand when you are
    converting a package from debstd to debhelper. "dh_debstd -v" will
    output the sequence of debhelper commands that approximate what debstd
    would do in the same situation.
  * dh_debstd is completly untested, I don't have the source to any packages
    that use debstd available. Once this is tested, I plan to release
    debhelper 1.0!
  * Added a from-debstd document that gives a recipe to convert from debstd
    to debhelper.
  * dh_fixperms: can now use -X to exclude files from having their
    permissions changed.
  * dh_testroot: test for uid == 0, instead of username == root, becuase
    some people enjoy changing root's name.
  * dh_installinit: handle debian/init.d as well as debian/init files,
    for backwards compatibility with debstd. Unlike with debstd, the two
    files are treated identically.
  * dh_lib, PROGRAMMING: added "warning" function.
  * Minor man page fixes.
  * dh_compress: don't bomb out if usr/doc/<package> is empty. (#23054)
  * dh_compress, dh_installdirs: always cd into $TMP and back out, even if
    --no-act is on. (#23054)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  1 Jun 1998 21:57:45 -0400

debhelper (0.88) unstable; urgency=low

  * I had many hours on a train to hack on debhelper... enjoy!
  * dh_compress: always pass -f to gzip, to force compression.
  * dh_compress: added -X switch, to make it easy to specify files to
    exclude, without all the bother of a debian/compress script. You can
    use -X multiple times, too.
  * PROGRAMMING, dh_getopt.pl: DH_EXCLUDE is now a variable set by the
    --exclude (-X) switch. -x now sets DH_INCLUDE_CONFFILES.

debhelper (0.87) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_strip: strip .comment and .note, not comment and note, when stripping
    elf binaries. This makes for smaller output files. This has always been
    broken in debhelper before! (#22395)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 13 May 1998 11:54:29 -0700

debhelper (0.86) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: don't try to re-compress *.gz files. Eliminates warning
    messages in some cases, shouldn't actually change the result at all.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 27 Apr 1998 15:21:33 -0700

debhelper (0.85) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved a few things around that were broken by Che's patch:
    - dh_installdirs should go in install target.
    - dh_clean should not run in binary targets.
  * This is just a quick fix to make it work, I'm not happy with it. I'm
    going to discuss my problems with it with Che, and either make a new
    version fixing them, or revert to 0.83.
  * So be warned that the example rules files are not currently in good
    shape if you're starting a new package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Apr 1998 23:30:38 -0700

debhelper (0.84) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied Che_Fox'x patches to example rules files, which makes them use
    an install target internally to move things into place in debian/tmp.

debhelper (0.83) unstable; urgency=low

  * Generate symlinks in build stage of debian/rules. cvs cannot create them
    properly. Note that version 0.80 and 0.81 could not build some packages

    Thanks to Bdale Garbee <bdale@gag.com> and Adam Heath
    <adam.heath@usa.net> for help on the implementation.
  * dh_installchangelogs: use debian/package.changelog files if they exist
    rather than debian/changelog. It appears some people do need per-package
    changelogs.
  * dh_gencontrol: if debian/package.changelogs files exist, use them.
  * Above 2 changes close #20442.

debhelper (0.78) frozen unstable; urgency=low

  * More spelling fixes from Christian T. Steigies. (I ignored the spelling
    fixes to the changelog, though - too many, and a changelog isn't meant

    dh_makeshlibs would die. Corrected this.

  * dh_installmanpages: if the man page filename ends in 'x', install it in
    /usr/X11R6/man/.
  * TODO: expanded descriptions of stuff, in the hope someone else will get
    inspired to implement some of it.
  *  Also added all wishlist bugs to the TODO.

debhelper (0.61) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: Add / to end of egrep -v regexp, fixes it so
    debian/icewm.1 can be found.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 11 Feb 1998 09:09:28 -0800

debhelper (0.60) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: make all files readable and writable by owner
    (policy 3.3.8 paragraph 2).
    Lintian found lots of bugs that will be fixed by this change.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  9 Feb 1998 12:26:13 -0800

debhelper (0.59) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added DH_NO_ACT and --no-act, which make debhelper commands run without
    actually doing anything. (Combine with -v to see what the command would
    have done.) (#17598)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun,  1 Feb 1998 14:51:08 -0800

debhelper (0.58) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed bug #17597 - DH_VERBOSE wasn'talways taking effect.

debhelper (0.57) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.56) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: Applied patch from Yann Dirson <ydirson@a2points.com>,
    to make it not abort of one of the find's fails.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 15 Jan 1998 19:16:48 -0500

debhelper (0.55) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_clean: delete substvarsfiles probperly again (broken in 0.53). #17077
  * Added call to dh_movefiles, and a commented out call to dh_testversion,
    to some of the sample rules files. #17076

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 14 Jan 1998 12:48:43 -0500

debhelper (0.54) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: no longer call getopt(1) to parse options. I wrote my own
    argument processor in perl.
  * Added long versions of all arguments. TODO: document them.
  * All parameters may now be passed values that include whitespace (ie,
    dh_installinit -u"defaults 10")
  * Now depends on perl (needs Getopt::Long).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 10 Jan 1998 15:44:09 -0500

debhelper (0.53) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmanpages: ignore all man pages installed into debian/tmp
    type directories. (#16933)
  * dh_*: set up alternative name for files like debian/dirs; you may now
    use debian/<mainpackage>.dirs too, for consistency. (#16934)
  * dh_installdocs: if a debian/package.copyright file exists, use it in
    preference to debian/copyright, so subpackages with varying copyrights
    are supported. (#16935)
  * Added dh_movefiles, which moves files out of debian/tmp into subpackages.
    (#16932)

  * dh_compress: compress file belongs in debian/. It was looking in ./
    This has been broken since version 0.30.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue,  6 Jan 1998 14:08:31 -0500

debhelper (0.51) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: make shared libraries non-executable, in accordance with
    policy. (#16644)
  * dh_makeshlibs: introduced a -V flag, which allows you to specify explicit
    version requirements in the shlibs file.
  * dh_{installdirs,installdocs,installexamples,suidregister,undocumented}:
    Added a -A flag, which makes any files/directories specified on the
    command line apply to ALL packages acted on.
  * Updated Standards-Version to latest.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Jan 1998 16:15:01 -0500

debhelper (0.50) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_makeshlibs: added -m parameter, which can force the major number
    of the shared library if it is guessed incorrectly.
  * Added dh_testversion to let your package depend on a certian version of
    debhelper to build.
  * dh_{installdirs,installdocs,installexamples,suidregieter,undocumented}:
    behavior modification - any files/directories specified on the command
    line now apply to the first package acted on. This may not be the
    first package listed in debian/control, if you use -p to make it act on
    a given package, or -i or -a.
  * If you take advantage of the above new behavior, I suggest you add
    "dh_testversion 0.50" to your debian/rules.
  * Display a warning message in cases where the above behavior is triggered,
    and debhelper's behavior has altered.
  * I have grepped debian's source packages, and I'm quite sure this
    is not going to affect any packages currently in debian.
  * dh_lib: isnative() now caches its return value, which should optimize
    away several more calls to dpkg-parsechangelog.
  * README: explain a way to embed debhelper generated shell script into a
    perl script.
  * dh_installinit: A hack to work around the problem in getopt(1) that
    led to bug report #16229: Any text specified on the command line that is
    not a flag will be presumed to be part of the -u flag. Yuck.

debhelper (0.37) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_du: Fixed hardcoded debian/tmp.
  * This change got lost by accident, redid it: Optimized out most of the
    slowdown caused by using dpkg-parsechangelog - now it's only called by
    2 dh_* programs.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 28 Dec 1997 20:45:22 -0500

debhelper (0.36) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_undocumented: exit with an error message if the man page specified
    does not have a section.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Dec 1997 14:14:04 -0500

debhelper (0.35) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: use dpkg-parsechangelog instead of parsing it by hand. This
    makes a package build slower (by about 30 seconds, on average), so
    I might remove it or optimize it if too many people yell at me. :-)
  * dh_undocumented.1: note that it really links to undocumented.7.gz.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Dec 1997 22:19:39 -0500

debhelper (0.34) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 22 Dec 1997 14:41:46 -0500

debhelper (0.33) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: use prefix, instead of PREFIX, becuase autoconf uses that.
    Also, use `pwd`/debian/tmp, instead of debian/tmp.
  * Always substitute #DEBHELPER# in maintainer scripts, even if it expands
    to nothing, for neatness and to save a few bytes. #15863
  * dh_clean: added -k parameter to not delete debian/files. #15789
  * examples/*: use dh_clean -k in the binary targets of all rules files,
    for safety.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 11 Dec 1997 19:05:41 -0500

debhelper (0.32) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split dh_installdebfiles into 3 programs (dh_installdeb, dh_shlibdeps,
    and dh_gencontrol). dh_installdebfiles still works, but is depricated.
  * Added an examples/rules.indep file.
  * examples/rules.multi: changed dh_du -a to dh_du -i in binary-indep
    section.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri,  5 Dec 1997 15:08:36 -0500

debhelper (0.29) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_lib: don't expand text passed to doit() a second time. This fixes
    #15624, and hopefully doesn't break anything else.
  * A side effect of this (of interest only to the debhelper programmer) is
    that doit() can no longer handle complex commands now. (ie, pipes, `;',
    `&', etc separating multiple commands, or redirection)
  * dh_makeshlibs, dh_md5sums, dh_installdebfiles, dh_du, dh_clean,
    dh_installdirs: don't pass complex commands to doit().

debhelper (0.26) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installdirs: Do not create usr/doc/$PACKAGE directory. Bug #15498
  * README: documented that $PACKAGE can be used in the arguments to some of
    the dh_* programs (#15497).
  * dh_du.1: no, this is not really the dh_md5sums man page (#15499).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 30 Nov 1997 13:01:40 -0500

debhelper (0.25) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_compress: was not reading debian/compress file - fixed.

debhelper (0.23) unstable; urgency=low

  * Now depends on fileutils (>= 3.16-4), becuase with any earlier version
    of fileutils, install -p will not work (#14680)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 19 Nov 1997 23:59:43 -0500

debhelper (0.22) unstable; urgency=low

    README.Debian is installed with the same name..)

debhelper (0.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installinit, which installs an init.d script, and edits the
    postinst, postrm, etc.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 14 Nov 1997 00:45:53 -0500

debhelper (0.19) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_installmenu.1: menufile is in section 5, not 1.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 12 Nov 1997 19:54:48 -0500

debhelper (0.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * examples/*: added source, diff targets that just print an error.
  * dh_clean: clean up more files - *.orig, *.rej, *.bak, .*.orig, .*.rej,
    .SUMS, TAGS, and empty files.
  * dh_lib: doit(): use eval on parameters, instead of directly running
    them. This lets me clean up several nasty areas where I had to echo the
    commands once, and then run them seperatly.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 10 Nov 1997 19:48:36 -0500

debhelper (0.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_installdirs, automatically creates subdirectories (for

debhelper (0.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * README: documented what temporary directories are used by default for
    installing package files into.
  * dh_*: added -P flag, to let a different package build directory be
    specified.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu,  6 Nov 1997 15:51:22 -0500

debhelper (0.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_fixperms: leave permissions on files in /usr/doc/packages/examples

debhelper (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed mispelling of dh_md5sums in examples rules files and README.
    (#13990) Thanks, Adrian.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Oct 1997 14:35:30 -0400

debhelper (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * dh_md5sums: behavior modification: do not generate md5sums for conffiles.
    (Thanks to Charles Briscoe-Smith <cpb4@ukc.ac.uk>) #14048.
  * dh_md5sums: can generate conffile md5sums with -x parameter.
  * Added a "converting from debstd" section to the README.
  * Added dh_du, generates a DEBIAN/du file with disk usage stats (#14048).

debhelper (0.10) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh_installdebfiles: fixed *bad* bug that messed up the names of all
    files installed into DEBIAN/ for multiple binary packages.
  * dh_md5sums: fixed another serious bug if dh_md5sums was used for
    multiple binary packages.
  * If you have made any multiple binary packages using debhelper, you
    should rebuild them with this version.
  * dh_md5sums: show cd commands in verbose mode.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 20 Oct 1997 14:44:30 -0400

debhelper (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added dh_suidregister, interfaces to to the suidmanager package.

debhelper (0.7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Sped up some things by removing unnecesary for loops.
  * dh_installdocs: behavior modifcation: if there is a debian/TODO, it is
    named like a debian/changelog file: if the package is a debian native
    package, it is installed as TODO. If the package is not a native package,
    it is installed as TODO.Debian.
  * dh_installdocs: handle debian/README.Debian as well as
    debian/README.debian.
  * Added dh_undocumented program, which can set up undocumented.7 symlinks.
  * Moved dh_installdebfiles to come after dh_fixperms in the example rules
    files. (dh_installdebfiles makes sure it installs things with the proper
    permissions, and this reorganization makes the file a bit more flexable
    in a few situations.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 13 Oct 1997 20:08:05 -0400

debhelper (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

debhelper (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for automatic generation of debian install scripts to
    dh_installmenu and dh_installdebfiles and dh_clean.
  * Removed some pointless uses of cat.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 26 Sep 1997 21:52:53 -0400

debhelper (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Moved out of unstable, it still has rough edges and incomplete bits, but
    is ready for general use.
  * Added man pages for all commands.
  * Multiple binary package support.
  * Support for specifying exactly what set of binary packages to act on,
    by group (arch or noarch), and by package name.
  * dh_clean: allow specification of additional files to remove as
    parameters.
  * dh_compress: fixed it to not compress doc/package/copyright
  * dh_installmanpage: allow listing of man pages that should not be
    auto-installed as parameters.
  * dh_installdebfiles: make sure all installed files have proper ownerships
    and permissions.
  * dh_installdebfiles: only pass ELF files to dpkg-shlibdeps, and pass .so
    files.
  * Added a README.
  * dh_compress: changed behavior - debian/compress script is now run inside
    the package build directory it is to act on.
  * Added dh_lib symlink in debian/ so the debhelper apps used in this
    package's debian/rules always use the most up-to-date db_lib.
  * Changed dh_cleantmp commands in the examples rules files to dh_clean.
