  * Revert "Drop fallback for old versions of systemd that didn't have
    is-enabled"
    If a package ships both init script and systemd service file, the
    systemd unit will not be enabled by the time invoke-rc.d is called
    (with current debhelper sequence). This would make systemctl is-enabled
    report the wrong status, and then the service would not be started.
    Add a comment noting this to avoid removing again in the future.

    If the TEST_ON_REAL_SYSTEM environment variable is set, the bind

    tests in a mount namespace.
  * tests: Make sure that the tests do not clutter the host system.

  * Align policy-rc.d existing/nonexisting case for custom actions.
    Previously, when calling invoke-rc.d with a "custom" action, it

  [ Andreas Henriksson ]
  * Do policy-rc.d automatically in init-less chroots.
    See #838966 and #838997 for background.
    A debootstrap with --variant=minbase will have lsb-base installed,
    so the person running into this issue must have:
     - not added a policy-rc.d in his init-less chroot
     - removed lsb-base manually (and what else?)
    This patch auto-detects the situation with init-less chroot that's
    missing a policy-rc.d and deals with it automatically (plus gives

    This dependency can probably be dropped after stretch is released.
  * update-rc.d: allow trailing whitespace in LSB header delimiters.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * invoke-rc.d, service: Only ignore systemd unit dependencies before
    default.target. "systemctl is-system-running" might still be false in case
    of running jobs for device/mount/hotplug/dynamic actions units. But in
    those cases we already do want to respect unit dependencies, as the system
    is booted up sufficiently to avoid dependency loops. Fixes installation of

    packages right after booting. (LP: #1576692)
  * invoke-rc.d, service: Asynchronously reload systemd units.
    Reloading SysV init scripts has never been synchronous, so use --no-block
    to reload them under systemd. This is another, and a better, line of
    defence against if-up.d hook deadlocks during boot (see

  * update-rc.d: Add fallback if insserv is not available.
    If insserv is not available, we are either under systemd or a chroot,
    where the rc?.d/ link priorities don't matter, so create the
    /etc/rc?.d/[SK]01<name> links with a hardcoded "01" priority.
    Drop insserv dependency again.
  * invoke-rc.d: Add SysV fallback for "systemctl is-enabled".
    Version 1.35 switched to "systemctl is-enabled" to determine if a service
    is enabled. This also has worked for SysV init scripts since systemd 220-1
    (via the systemd-sysv-install wrapper), but does not yet work under
    Jessie's systemd 215. Add a fallback to checking runlevel symlinks (for
    any runlevel) to fix upgrades where init-system-helpers gets upgraded
    before systemd, and to make i-s-h backportable to Jessie.

  * invoke-rc.d: Drop fallback code for ancient upstart versions.
    Even wheezy ships a version >= 0.9.7.
  * invoke-rc.d: Only consider the enabled-state for start and restart.
    We should not deny other actions, like status, stop or reload on
    disabled services.
  * invoke-rc.d: Don't check the enabled state twice.
    On start|restart we already enforce the local policy and RC will be set
    to 101, if the service was disabled.
    Also, checking for the output of "systemctl --quiet is-enabled" is
    problematic, as it is currently broken for non-native services [1].

    Add some conditions to start the job on deb-system-invoke [restart|start],

    - deb-system-invoke restart <unit> only restarts a disabled or static unit
      if the daemon was already running (forced by the admin).
